Rumours spread that organs were being taken from the dead. Relatives began hiding Ebola victims and burying them secretly, worsening the spread of the disease. The authorities were persuaded to allow a small number of relatives, accompanied by a pastor, priest or imam, to witness burials, and graves were marked for later identification, giving the dead more dignity::0f7919517720d12f84738135d54022c2::ACKNOWLEDGED 0f7919517720d12f84738135d54022c2

The visit was said to be aimed at sensitising the church and its membership on the menace of the deadly Ebola virus.   The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, who led the delegation, said it was also to make sure that no victim of the virus came into the church from any of the affected countries.  Idris said, “We have our strategies that we intend to share with you. Again, we need to know the resources you have here because whether it is one or two cases, if they are allowed to get out, it is a major problem. We are here to work together on how to contain this disease.”  Idris said the delegation decided to pay the visit to the SCOAN because of the recognition that it was an international Christian centre whose congregation comprised people from all over the world, including the countries of the West African sub-Region which had already been infected by the Ebola disease.  The Director, Centre for Disease Control, Professor Abdulsalami Nasidi, added that the visit was also to inform the Synagogue leader of the deadliness of the Ebola Virus, and ensure that it did not escape into the country.  ::2a002a34db3e7f5e9d97b5cb748746f7::ACKNOWLEDGED 2a002a34db3e7f5e9d97b5cb748746f7

"But the doctor, a nice and conscientious professional suspected that Dr. Enemuo was either hiding something or was suffering from a strange ailment because he proved negative to malaria, fever and typhoid fever. To be sure of what he was doing, he spoke to other very experienced doctors about the strange case he was handling in his hospital.  “He even invited some of  his colleagues to come over to his hospital to study Dr. Enemuo’s medical history. Of course, the news of the Ebola virus was everywhere, so, they were afraid to go. None of them showed up at the hospital where Dr. Enemuo was being treated.

His evasion of quarantine in Lagos which the Minister of Health as representative of the President had facilitated can be said to be a violation of the Act, as he deliberately thwarted the efforts of government to contain the Ebola virus in Lagos and prevent its spread to Rivers State.  So it can be interpreted that Mr. Koye violated our 84 year old Act. Imagine the balls! So what does the law prescribe for such devious audacity?  Let us put it like this: If Mr. Koye is dragged before a magistrate court today according to section 7 of the Quarantine Act, his punishment if found guilty is prescribed in section 5 which states that “any violation of the provisions of the Act attracts a penalty of N200 fine or six months imprisonment or both.”  **::99585ff1b3d9dce083032393aef3187b::ACKNOWLEDGED 99585ff1b3d9dce083032393aef3187b
