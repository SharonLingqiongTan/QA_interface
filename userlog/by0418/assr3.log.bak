After outbreaks in Uganda in the late 1990âs, scientists tested the blood of several people who were in close contact with Ebola patients, and found a number of them had markers in their blood indicating they carried the disease, but they were totally asymptomaticâthey managed to completely avoid the horrifying symptoms of the disease.  ::7a2c9deb19b97ade31ceab77c567c85d::ACKNOWLEDGED 7a2c9deb19b97ade31ceab77c567c85d

And if the effect such immunity can be confirmed, say the authors, it could have a significant impact on projections of how widely Ebola will spread. It could also help contain the outbreak.  They urge public health authorities to carry out a prompt investigation to establish how commonplace such immunity to Ebola might be. How many people have been infected without developing symptoms or spreading the disease? And are they likely to be protected from future outbreaks?  ::19410838578f026d83ece3172464d7fd::ACKNOWLEDGED 19410838578f026d83ece3172464d7fd

"We found a striking activation of both B and T cells in all four patients," wrote lead study author Dr. Anita McElroy, an infectious disease researcher at Emory.  McElroy and her colleagues found that immature B cells, or plasmablasts, that were actively secreting antibody accounted for 50% of all B cells in infected individuals, compared with less than 1% in healthy individuals.  Likewise, the frequency of activated CD4 T cells -- white blood cells that help direct immune cell response -- ranged from 5% to 30% in the patients, compared with 1% to 2% in healthy individuals.  ::3f38305b0a4cc2611b0b68970d69595f::ACKNOWLEDGED 3f38305b0a4cc2611b0b68970d69595f

Antibodies to the virus were found in 15.3% of rural communities, whereas these people had never had haemorrhagic fever or other specific symptoms of the disease (such as severe diarrhoea or vomiting). IRD researchers and their partners1 recently discovered this large number of healthy carriers among Gabonese people, even in areas where there has never been an Ebola outbreak. The scientists consider that these people have somehow come into contact with the virus, probably present in fruit contaminated by saliva from Chiroptera (fruit bats)2.  ::25e698ed665870673f128685d4f6e262::ACKNOWLEDGED 25e698ed665870673f128685d4f6e262

This part of immunity keeps a virus from quickly reproducing inside cells.  To trigger an effective, early response to viral infection, interferons must pass on their signal to other cells. This occurs through other messengers inside cells as part of interferon signaling pathways, with the last of these messengers turning on genes inside the nuclei of cells to drive the immune response.    ::8b9cde51e5665bb1622c631ae2794ce9::ACKNOWLEDGED 8b9cde51e5665bb1622c631ae2794ce9

These individuals can either be hetero or homozygous for the mutation, conferring greater protection with two copies. It's the same mutation that protects against Smallpox and HIV, though not 100%. Contrary to some articles, this is not a particularly good mutation as the normal (external) receptor has immunity jobs that aren't carried out with the receptor inside the cell. There has been some talk of Black Plague being the cause of the selection pressure, but some newer analysis has shown numerically that it was probably the 1000+ years of Smallpox that conferred the mutation. This is perhaps why the alleged cures in Africa too place, from using the HIV drugs. Those drugs were likely CCR5 antagonists and virus was unable to enter the T-cell and replicate. The idea with the Africans is that there is probably some European genetics in those with ancestors who came from America after the Civil War. Thoughts?

This is perhaps because of some unknown genetic advantage, reports The New York Times.  "It's fair to say that some people are immune," said Robert F. Garry Jr., a Tulane University expert in hemorrhagic fevers who works in Sierra Leone.  In 2000, Dr. Leroy's team studied 24 Gabonese who had tended victims without ever falling ill. Eleven had not just antibodies but remnants of virus and markers of inflammation in their blood. They had clearly been infected and defeated the virus on their own.  "But we don't know if it's one percent, two percent or twenty percent."  There are about 1,800 survivors of the current West African outbreak, all of whom are now immune. But there may be many thousands more.  Determining the overall level of immunity in West Africa would require testing thousands of blood samples, an impossible task in the current conditions.  This knowledge could be a great help in fighting the current outbreak. Immune individuals could safely tend the sick and bury the dead just as smallpox survivors did in the centuries before smallpox vaccine. Also, scientist could harvest antibodies from their blood to treat new Ebola victims.  But many factors remain unclear, including which Africans have antibodies and how much antibody is needed to be protective.  The biggest mystery is how the immunity arose. It is possible that some get low doses of virus and become "vaccinated" by eating infected monkeys, bats that are undercooked, or fruit contaminated with bat saliva.  ::5b7af7a0fbc03cb50bd4f93f61567bb5::ACKNOWLEDGED 5b7af7a0fbc03cb50bd4f93f61567bb5

Still, she added, “there is really no scientific evidence.”  The survival rate during this outbreak is about 30 percent, according to the WHO. Immunity may stem from antibodies produced by the immune system to help people survive the disease in the first place. The antibodies are then primed to aggressively fight off any future threat from the same virus.  ::d44eeb627d1fbd8b7ba8c12c23c2e6db::ACKNOWLEDGED d44eeb627d1fbd8b7ba8c12c23c2e6db

And if the effect such immunity can be confirmed, say the authors, it could have a significant impact on projections of how widely Ebola will spread. It could also help contain the outbreak.  ::68e77d746c7e367aac80313eba261bbd::ACKNOWLEDGED 68e77d746c7e367aac80313eba261bbd

However, new research published Monday in the journal PNAS suggests that the human immune system doesn't give up that easily when confronted with Ebola virus disease.  In tests performed on the four Ebola patients treated at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, doctors discovered that each of the patients' immune systems had mounted a surprisingly strong counterattack.

Using a cell culture model for Ebola virus infection, they have discovered that the virus disables a cellular protein called tetherin that normally can block the spread of virus from cell to cell. "Tetherin represents a new class of cellular factors that possess a very different means of inhibiting viral replication," says study author Paul Bates, PhD, Associate Professor of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. "Tetherin is the first example of a protein that affects the virus replication cycle after the virus is fully made and prevents the virus from being able to go off and infect the next cell." These findings appear online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  When a cell is infected with a virus like Ebola, which is deadly to 90 percent of people infected, the cell is pirated by the virus and turned into a production factory that makes massive quantities on new virions. These virions are then released from that cell to infect other cells and promote the spreading infection.  Tetherin is one of the immune system's responses to a viral infection. If working properly, tetherin stops the infected cell from releasing the newly made virus, thus shutting down spread to other cells. However, this study shows that the Ebola virus has developed a way to disable tetherin, thus blocking the body's response and allowing the virus to spread.

The team further showed that CD8 T cells are the major source of cytokines in response to acute Ebola infection. Moreover, in the absence of anti-Ebola antibodies, so-called memory CD8 T cells can apparently stave off infection. The researchers hope to understand the mechanism of this immune protection through further research.::c3c0e91a6d9d30448838a87f1f1696ac::ACKNOWLEDGED c3c0e91a6d9d30448838a87f1f1696ac

"We've known for a long time that infection with Ebola obstructs an important immune compound called interferon," said Amarasinghe. "Now we know how Ebola does this, and that can guide the development of new treatments."  According to the researchers, VP24 works by preventing the transcription factor STAT1, which carries interferon's antiviral message, from entering the nucleus and initiating an immune response. As part of a rapid immune response, the cell allows STAT1 an "emergency access lane" to the nucleus. Rather than block all nuclear transfer, however, VP24 focuses on blocking STAT1's "emergency access lane."  "::f5904690eb773ca11e10aae53297bc20::ACKNOWLEDGED f5904690eb773ca11e10aae53297bc20

In general, patients who have recovered from Ebola virus infection do develop a very robust immunity to the virus. They develop antibodies against the virus and they also develop cell-mediated immunity—the lymphocytes important to form viral control of pathogens. In general, the finding is it’s basically like being immunized—it would be unusual to get infection with the same strain.   Will that immunity afford them protection against other strains of Ebola? We are still evaluating that in our two patients. Cross-protection is not quite as robust. There are five strains of Ebola viruses. Even though that data is not great, the feeling is there is potential for being infected if you go to a different part of Africa and get exposed to a different strain.   ::f79857b97875426f43a60fbb8a999b04::ACKNOWLEDGED f79857b97875426f43a60fbb8a999b04

Assuming they are correct, and if those people can be identified, they could be a great help in fighting the outbreak. Immune persons could safely tend the sick and bury the dead just as smallpox survivors did in the centuries before smallpox vaccine.::2073feb8390769b83710d89776bed10b::ACKNOWLEDGED 2073feb8390769b83710d89776bed10b

Nineteen percent of the mice were unfazed. They not only survived, but also fully regained their lost weight within two weeks. They had no gross pathological evidence of disease. Their livers looked normal.  Eleven percent were partially resistant and less than half of these died. Seventy percent of the mice had a greater than 50 percent mortality. Nineteen percent of this last group had liver inflammation without classic symptoms of Ebola, and thirty-four percent had blood that took too long to clot, a hallmark of fatal Ebola hemorrhagic fever in humans. Those mice also had internal bleeding, swollen spleens and changes in liver color and texture.::931fdc97030ffcde9bd3768f6e90fd47::ACKNOWLEDGED 931fdc97030ffcde9bd3768f6e90fd47
