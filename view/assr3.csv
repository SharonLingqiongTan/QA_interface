After outbreaks in Uganda in the late 1990âs  scientists tested the blood of several people who were in close contact with Ebola patients  and found a number of them had markers in their blood indicating they carried the disease  but they were totally asymptomaticâthey managed to completely avoid the horrifying symptoms of the disease.  ,ebola-81b32ef4e2fd335b221b386e3e185b23012de61c49c4560084073bee9a7db9ab,0,465,1,2016-04-13 12:51:51.202861,

Antibodies to the virus were found in 15.3% of rural communities  whereas these people had never had haemorrhagic fever or other specific symptoms of the disease (such as severe diarrhoea or vomiting). IRD researchers and their partners1 recently discovered this large number of healthy carriers among Gabonese people  even in areas where there has never been an Ebola outbreak. The scientists consider that these people have somehow come into contact with the virus  probably present in fruit contaminated by saliva from Chiroptera (fruit bats)2.  ,ebola-ce10a2c92c97ac2397e04d2db0f2c7a2ce00df33859c2a7e2d43b85d0da0d0fe,0,642,2,2016-04-13 13:34:47.592649,

These individuals can either be hetero or homozygous for the mutation  conferring greater protection with two copies. It's the same mutation that protects against Smallpox and HIV  though not 100%. Contrary to some articles  this is not a particularly good mutation as the normal (external) receptor has immunity jobs that aren't carried out with the receptor inside the cell. There has been some talk of Black Plague being the cause of the selection pressure  but some newer analysis has shown numerically that it was probably the 1000+ years of Smallpox that conferred the mutation. This is perhaps why the alleged cures in Africa too place  from using the HIV drugs. Those drugs were likely CCR5 antagonists and virus was unable to enter the T-cell and replicate. The idea with the Africans is that there is probably some European genetics in those with ancestors who came from America after the Civil War. Thoughts?

1,Ebola,3,assr3,351,is there a natural immunity to ebola,25,who has a natural immunity to ebola,216,Small studies of household contacts of Ebola victims in West Africa show that some people are infected with the virus without ever falling ill. This is perhaps because of some unknown genetic advantage  reports The New York Times.  "It's fair to say that some people are immune " said Robert F. Garry Jr.  a Tulane University expert in hemorrhagic fevers who works in Sierra Leone.  In 2000  Dr. Leroy's team studied 24 Gabonese who had tended victims without ever falling ill. Eleven had not just antibodies but remnants of virus and markers of inflammation in their blood. They had clearly been infected and defeated the virus on their own.  "But we don't know if it's one percent  two percent or twenty percent."  There are about 1 800 survivors of the current West African outbreak  all of whom are now immune. But there may be many thousands more.  Determining the overall level of immunity in West Africa would require testing thousands of blood samples  an impossible task in the current conditions.  This knowledge could be a great help in fighting the current outbreak. Immune individuals could safely tend the sick and bury the dead just as smallpox survivors did in the centuries before smallpox vaccine. Also  scientist could harvest antibodies from their blood to treat new Ebola victims.  But many factors remain unclear  including which Africans have antibodies and how much antibody is needed to be protective.  The biggest mystery is how the immunity arose. It is possible that some get low doses of virus and become "vaccinated" by eating infected monkeys  bats that are undercooked  or fruit contaminated with bat saliva.  ,ebola-74069b78b9a189125b3a54f134bc9ac874cea9251cbd68ad704ec312588ca58d,0,1642,2,2016-04-13 13:46:29.690704,

Nineteen percent of the mice were unfazed. They not only survived  but also fully regained their lost weight within two weeks. They had no gross pathological evidence of disease. Their livers looked normal.  Eleven percent were partially resistant and less than half of these died. Seventy percent of the mice had a greater than 50 percent mortality.

In general  patients who have recovered from Ebola virus infection do develop a very robust immunity to the virus. They develop antibodies against the virus and they also develop cell-mediated immunity—the lymphocytes important to form viral control of pathogens. In general  the finding is it’s basically like being immunized—it would be unusual to get infection with the same strain.   Will that immunity afford them protection against other strains of Ebola? We are still evaluating that in our two patients. Cross-protection is not quite as robust. There are five strains of Ebola viruses. Even though that data is not great  the feeling is there is potential for being infected if you go to a different part of Africa and get exposed to a different strain.   ,ebola-307d1d9090883ee10df7c7ba3654cb4ca1a4a24c36788071910a92629d65aa4c,0,830,2,2016-04-14 13:06:26.931058,

This part of immunity keeps a virus from quickly reproducing inside cells.  To trigger an effective  early response to viral infection  interferons must pass on their signal to other cells. This occurs through other messengers inside cells as part of interferon signaling pathways  with the last of these messengers turning on genes inside the nuclei of cells to drive the immune response.    ,ebola-bd50f1ab8733687ee93cdd110a9cfce81a1ca2ddb2eb5c0f7d420dbdeba2d0d7,0,630,2,2016-04-13 13:36:55.229916,

Using a cell culture model for Ebola virus infection  they have discovered that the virus disables a cellular protein called tetherin that normally can block the spread of virus from cell to cell. "Tetherin represents a new class of cellular factors that possess a very different means of inhibiting viral replication " says study author Paul Bates  PhD  Associate Professor of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. "Tetherin is the first example of a protein that affects the virus replication cycle after the virus is fully made and prevents the virus from being able to go off and infect the next cell." These findings appear online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  When a cell is infected with a virus like Ebola  which is deadly to 90 percent of people infected  the cell is pirated by the virus and turned into a production factory that makes massive quantities on new virions. These virions are then released from that cell to infect other cells and promote the spreading infection.  Tetherin is one of the immune system's responses to a viral infection. If working properly  tetherin stops the infected cell from releasing the newly made virus  thus shutting down spread to other cells.

U,1206,In the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa  whose death toll is approaching 10 000  little information has been available about how the human immune response unfolds after infection.  Researchers from Emory and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now obtained a first look at the immune responses in four Ebola virus disease survivors who received care at Emory University Hospital in 2014  by closely examining their T cells and B cells during the acute phase of the disease. The findings reveal surprisingly high levels of immune activation  and have implications for the current effort to develop vaccines against Ebola.  All four patients' immune systems showed strong signs of T and B cell activation  according to a paper published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Some previous research on Ebola virus disease had suggested that immune responses could be impaired.  "Our findings counter the idea that Ebola virus infection is immunosuppressive  at least in the patients that we were able to study " says lead author Anita McElroy  MD  assistant professor of pediatrics (infectious disease) at Emory University School of Medicine and a guest researcher at CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch. "They also demonstrate the value that supportive care may have in enabling the immune system to fight back against Ebola virus infection."  The paper emerged from a collaboration between immunologists at Emory Vaccine Center led by Rafi Ahmed  PhD  Aneesh Mehta  MD and Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit team  and investigators from CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch  led by Christina Spiropoulou  PhD.

U,1209,In a study published in PLoS Pathogens  researchers at Emory University have discovered a potentially important mechanism by which the Ebola virus alters and evades the immune response of its infected host.  Ebola virus is the causative agent of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF)  a disease with up to 90 percent mortality. While human outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have been confined to Africa  Ebola virus infections in bats  the presumed natural reservoir of the virus  have also been detected in Europe and Asia. Ebola virus infection has also been reported in domestic pigs in Southeast Asia.   The high lethality of the disease  combined with its short incubation period and the lack of vaccines or effective treatments  makes Ebola virus a significant public health threat as well as a potentially devastating biological weapon.   Efforts to develop a vaccine against Ebola virus have met with limited success  and it is likely that the virus employs complex immune evasion mechanisms that present unique challenges for vaccine design.

While human outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have been confined to Africa  Ebola virus infections in bats  the presumed natural reservoir of the virus  have also been detected in Europe and Asia.

Understanding these evasion mechanisms is a critical first step in developing an effective vaccine.  In this study  published in PLoS Pathogens  the authors examined the role of a protein secreted in large quantities by Ebola virus-infected cells. The protein shares regions with a membrane protein that the virus expresses on its surface and uses to initiate the infection process.

The new website  with the ability to freely download information  is publicly available at: www.emoryhealthcare.org/ebolaprep.  The Emory Healthcare Ebola Preparedness Protocols website includes policies  procedures and protocols developed within Emory Healthcare to enable physicians and staff to deal safely and effectively with various risk categories of patients who could be or are infected with the Ebola virus. The website will be updated as more information is available.  “Health care providers throughout the United States are very concerned about the potential spread of Ebola virus and the possible arrival of patients with Ebola virus disease at their emergency departments  hospitals and clinics ” says John Fox  President and CEO of Emory Healthcare.  “We fully acknowledge the risk factors that make this area of health care very challenging for any organization. However  we firmly believe that all of American health care needs some level of preparedness for Ebola and other types of communicable diseases that can always impact us at any point. Emory Healthcare is committed to sharing our processes and experience on how to provide safe  effective care for patients with Ebola virus disease.  The website provides guidance on initial screening of patients at all entry points into hospitals and clinics  as well as detailed protocols including confirmation of diagnosis  treatment  waste management  clinical laboratories  advanced supportive care  potential complications and discharge.

U.,8296,For months  Vanderbilt University researcher Dr. James Crowe has been desperately seeking access to the blood of U.S. Ebola survivors  hoping to extract the proteins that helped them overcome the deadly virus for use in new  potent drugs.   His efforts finally paid off in mid-November with a donation from Dr. Rick Sacra  a University of Massachusetts physician who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia.   The donation puts Crowe at the forefront of a new model for fighting the virus  now responsible for the worst known outbreak in West Africa that has killed nearly 7 000 people.  "They can take antibodies they find in my blood and map them out ” Sacra said in an interview. “They are looking for the ones that are most important in neutralizing the virus.”   Sacra  a medical missionary for Christian group SIM USA  said he made the blood donation with “no strings attached ” and does not stand to gain financially if a product based on his antibodies reaches the market.  Crowe is working with privately-held drugmaker Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc  which he said will manufacture the antibodies for further testing under a National Institutes of Health grant. Mapp is currently testing its own drug ZMapp  a cocktail of three antibodies that has shown promise in treating a handful of Ebola patients.  Crowe’s hope is to improve on ZMapp by isolating the human antibodies of actual survivors and create a drug effective against all strains of Ebola.  Several leading scientists have embraced the idea of using survivors’ antibodies as the most promising approach in the fight against Ebola.   Crowe is also part of a large consortium of academic and corporate partners working to develop and test human antibodies from Ebola survivors treated at Emory University that is being assembled by Department of Defense.  The push is part of the race to develop drugs to address the ongoing outbreak in Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea. Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp is also testing a treatment  while drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline and Merck  in partnership with NewLink Genetics  are working on vaccines.  ,ebola-555bca17f4470ca14d666b73572bd11157e6c728ebbfa4ba03fae4d74011d856,0,2124,0,2016-05-06 15:35:33.394786,

U.,8453,Bruce Ribner  the Emory University Hospital epidemiologist who oversees the isolated unit at the hospital set up to treat patients exposed to certain infectious diseases  speaks at a news conference  Friday  Aug. 1  2014  in Atlanta. Ribner said Friday two American aid workers infected with the Ebola virus in Africa will be treated at Emory University Hospital. (Photo: AP) New York: When two U.S. aid workers infected with Ebola arrive in Atlanta from Africa  they will be whisked into one of the most sophisticated hospital isolation units in the country.   The specialized unit at Emory University Hospital was opened a dozen years ago to care for federal health workers exposed to some of the world's most dangerous germs. Now it's being pressed into service for the two seriously ill Americans who worked at a hospital in Liberia  one of the three West Africa countries hit by the largest Ebola outbreak in history.   One of the aid workers is due to arrive on Saturday  and the second a few days later  according to officials at the hospital. They are traveling in a private jet outfitted with a special  portable tent designed for patients with highly infectious diseases. It will be the first time anyone infected with Ebola is brought into the country. U.S. officials are confident they can be treated without putting the public in any danger.   The Emory hospital unit is located just down a hill from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is one of about four such units around the country for testing and treating people infected with dangerous  infectious germs. The unit has its own laboratory equipment so samples don't have to be sent to the main hospital lab. Located on the ground floor  it's carefully separated from other patient areas  said Dr. Eileen Farnon  a Temple University doctor who formerly worked at the CDC and led teams investigating past Ebola outbreaks in Africa.   The two Americans - Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol - worked for U.S. aid groups Samaritan's Purse and SIM at a Liberian hospital that treated Ebola patients. Late last week  the North Carolina-based Samaritan's Purse said Brantly  33  had been diagnosed with Ebola. Then  Writebol's infection was disclosed. The government is working to ensure that any Ebola-related evacuations "are carried out safely  thereby protecting the patient and the American public " State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement released Friday.   A Department of Defense spokesman said Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta  Georgia  will be used for the transfer. Samaritan's Purse is paying for the trip. Ebola is considered one of the world's deadliest diseases. The current outbreak in Liberia  Guinea and Sierra Leone has sickened more than 1 300 people and killed more than 700 this year.   The virus is spread through direct contact with blood  urine  saliva and other bodily fluids from an infected person. It is not spread through the air so it is not as infectious as a germ like the flu. The Americans will travel on a Gulfstream jet fitted with a collapsible  clear tent built to transfer CDC employees exposed to contagious diseases. The CDC said the private jet can only accommodate one patient at a time.   An Emory emergency medical team in Liberia has evaluated the two aid workers  and deemed both stable enough for the trip to Atlanta  said Emory's Dr. Bruce Ribner. Hospital spokesman Vincent Dollard said the first patient was scheduled to arrive Saturday.   "If there's any modern therapy that can be done " such as better monitoring of fluids  electrolytes and vital signs  workers will be able to do it better in this safe environment  said Dr. Philip Brachman  an Emory University public health specialist who for many years headed the CDC's disease detectives program.   "That's all we can do for such a patient. We can make them feel comfortable" and let the body try to beat back the virus  he said. There's no specific treatment for Ebola so doctors try to ease the symptoms  which include fever  headache  vomiting and diarrhea. Some cases suffer severe bleeding.   Emory's Ribner  one of the doctors who will be seeing the Ebola patients  stressed that safety precautions will be taken by staff. "I have no concerns about even my personal health or the health of the other health care workers who will be working in that area " Ribner said. Tags:  Ebola United States America World,ebola-15992f4e554a1f42b83f25cc7d47e569dadfe5f32609283a9987c0e9ca99bdd8,5,4430,0,2016-05-07 12:27:05.639498,

See More + The most severe impact of the Ebola epidemic  which began in Guinea in December 2013 and quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone  has been in lost human lives and suffering. This report  prepared for the World Economic Forum at Davos  focuses on the indirect  economic costs  in particular the effects on economic output in 2015. Most of the economic cost is driven by aversion behavior  which consists of both the actions taken by individuals to avoid exposure to the illness and actions taken by investors in anticipation of those individual choices. The report first estimates the impact of the epidemic on gross domestic product (GDP) in Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone. Here the report builds on sector-specific analysis to update World Bank forecasts for the three countries  and incorporates recent results of World Bank-financed cellphone surveys in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The authors evaluate the economic effects of the epidemic on the continent  beyond the three hardest-hit countries  using assessments by World Bank country economists across the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Finally  the report updates estimates from the global economic model of the research arm of the World Bank  to quantify the 2015 impact of the potential spread of the epidemic to other countries. Updated general equilibrium analysis suggests that further spread of the epidemic to other African economies  if the epidemic is not contained and instances of infection continue to occur in other countries  can potentially exact an economic toll of the order of 6 billion dollars. The results underscore the importance of: (a) Ebola and broader pandemic preparedness in African countries; and (b) reaching the goal of zero new cases as soon as possible in the three most affected countries.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,131,Countries affected most by ebola,1611,WASHINGTON  January 20  2015–The Ebola epidemic will continue to cripple the economies of Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone even as transmission rates in the three countries show significant signs of slowing  according to a World Bank Group analysis on the economic impact of Ebola in Africa. The Bank Group estimates that these three countries will lose at least US$1.6 billion in forgone economic growth in 2015 as a result of the epidemic.    But the new report — released on the eve of the 2015 World Economic Forum in Davos — also contains more positive news: the probability of spread and the associated economic costs beyond the three most-affected countries are now much lower than previously feared because of the intensive global and national responses to the epidemic over the past several months.  An earlier World Bank Group economic analysis (from October 8  2014) found that the West Africa region alone could experience a downside scenario of US$25 billion in economic losses in 2015  but the current report estimates the range for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole to be from a low of US$500 million to a high of US$6.2 billion.  The national and international responses have resulted in a number of public health improvements within the three West African nations  including safer burial practices  earlier case detections  more health workers and treatment facilities  public awareness campaigns and stepped-up contact tracing. These policy and behavior responses have contributed to a lower risk of spread across borders. The lower estimates also reflect fast and effective containment measures taken in the neighboring countries of Mali  Nigeria and Senegal  all of which have now been declared Ebola-free.  “Even if Ebola is controlled and further outbreaks avoided ” said the report  “economic costs will be incurred across sub-Saharan Africa in 2015. Consumer and investor confidence has been eroded by the outbreak of the virus  and disruptions to travel and cross-border trade suggest cumulative losses of more than US$500 million across the region in 2015  outside the three directly affected countries.” The report said the losses could be closer to the higher end of the estimate — US$6 billion — if the Ebola outbreak were to spread through the region  reinforcing the need for a swift end to the epidemic.  “I am very encouraged to see Ebola transmission rates slowing markedly in Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone  and that other potential outbreaks have been averted because of swift action by other West African governments ” said Jim Yong Kim  President of the World Bank Group  who will discuss the emerging lessons from the Ebola crisis with world leaders in Davos this week. “Yet as welcome as these latest signs are  we cannot afford to be complacent. Until we have zero new Ebola cases  the risk of continued severe economic impact to the three countries and beyond remains unacceptably high.”  The report notes that containment and preparedness efforts dramatically limited the potential impact of Ebola on the African economy  compared to earlier worst-case scenarios. The scope of the report did not include examining the national and international response to determine most effective policies in curtailing the spread of the virus.  One major lesson from the Ebola outbreak  said Kim  was for the world to respond much more quickly to epidemics.  “This report demonstrates why all countries should make investing in pandemic preparedness a top priority for 2015 ” said Kim. “It points to the need for a global pandemic emergency financing facility that will enable the world to respond much more quickly and effectively to any future deadly outbreaks  and avoid the tragic and unnecessary human and economic costs that have resulted from the Ebola epidemic,ebola-8e822df2f2f2fc922ed5804fb6bdb36369a367f3820fceed50869c33c07b3fce,0,3797,2,2016-04-15 14:23:10.686404, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,131,Countries affected most by ebola,1617,WASHINGTON  September 17  2014âA World Bank Group analysis of the Ebola epidemic released today finds that if the virus continues to surge in the three worst-affected countries â Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone â its economic impact could grow eight-fold  dealing a potentially catastrophic blow to the already fragile states.Â   However  the analysis finds that economic costs can be limited if swift national and international responses succeed in containing the epidemic and mitigating âaversion behaviorâ â a fear factor resulting from peoplesâ concerns about contagion  which is fueling the economic impact.  World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said  âThe primary cost of this tragic outbreak is in human lives and suffering  which has already been terribly difficult to bear. But our findings make clear that the sooner we get an adequate containment response and decrease the level of fear and uncertainty  the faster we can blunt Ebolaâs economic impact.â  âWe have seen in recent days a serious scaling up on the part of international donors to contain the Ebola epidemic. Todayâs report underscores the huge potential costs of the epidemic if we donât ramp up our efforts to stop it now â said Kim.  The analysis uses two alternative scenarios to estimate the medium-term impact of the epidemic to the end of calendar year 2015. A âLow Ebolaâ scenario envisions rapid containment within the three core countries  while âHigh Ebolaâ corresponds to the upper ranges of current epidemiological estimates.  Estimates of impacts on output individually and in aggregate   Entries are in current US dollars (with percentage points of GDP in brackets where appropriate).  The analysis estimates the short-term impact on output to be 2.1 percentage points of GDP in Guinea (reducing growth from 4.5 percent to 2.4 percent); 3.4 percentage points in Liberia (reducing growth from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent); and 3.3 percentage points in Sierra Leone (reducing growth from 11.3 percent to 8 percent). This forgone output corresponds to $359 million in 2014 prices.Â  However  if Ebola is not contained  these estimates rise to $809 million in the three countries alone. In Liberia  the hardest hit country  the High Ebola scenario sees output hit 11.7 percentage points in 2015 (reducing growth from 6.8 percent to -4.9 percent).  The short-term fiscal impacts are also large  at $93 million for Liberia (4.7 percent of GDP); $79 million for Sierra Leone (1.8 percent of GDP); and $120 million for Guinea (1.8 percent of GDP). Slow containment gaps would almost certainly lead to even greater financing gaps in 2015  the analysis finds.  Inflation and food prices were initially contained but are now rising in response to shortages  panic buying  and speculation.Â  Those families already vulnerable to food price shocks are becoming increasingly exposed. Exchange rate volatility has increased in all three countries  particularly since June  fueled by uncertainty and some capital flight.  The analysis finds that the largest economic effects of the crisis are not as a result of the direct costs (mortality  morbidity  caregiving  and the associated losses to working days) but rather those resulting from aversion behavior driven by fear of contagion.Â  This in turn leads to a fear of association with others and reduces labor force participation  closes places of employment  disrupts transportation  and motivates some government and private decision-makers to close sea ports and airports.Â  In the recent history of infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004 and the H1N1 flu epidemic of 2009  the analysis notes that behavioral effects have been responsible for as much as 80 â 90 percent of the total economic impact of the epidemics.  The findings of the analysis underline the need for a concerted international response.Â  External financing is clearly needed in the three core countries  and the impact estimates suggest that containment and mitigation expenditures as high as several billion dollars would be cost-effective if they successfully avert the worse scenario.Â   The analysis describes four related activities such a response should include:  The World Bank Group is mobilizing a $230 million financing package for the three countries hardest hit by the Ebola crisis  which will help contain the spread of infections  help communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis  and improve public health systems throughout West Africa. The WBG is supporting country responses in line with the WHO Roadmap  and is coordinating assistance closely with the UN and other international and country partners. As of mid-September 2014  of the pledged $230 million  the WBG has mobilized $117 million for the emergency response  which includes IDA* grants of $58 million for Liberia  $34 million for Sierra Leone  and $25 million for Guinea. These funds are paying for essential supplies and drugs  personal protective equipment and infection prevention control materials  health workers training  hazard pay and death benefits to Ebola health workers and volunteers  contact tracing  vehicles  data management equipment and door-to-door public health education outreach. Additional support will help strengthen countriesâ health systems and capacity to delivery essential health services  along with disease surveillance and laboratory networks to guard against future outbreaks.  The World Bank Group is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world  with the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Improving peopleâs health is integral to achieving these goals. The Bank Group provides financing  state-of-the-art analysis  and policy advice to help countries expand access to quality  affordable health care; protect people from falling into poverty or worsening poverty due to illness; and promote investments in all sectors that form the foundation of healthy societies.  ,ebola-0e99dc4e69d57afa571419cac72aff8c2d2e58cecfdc958be6b662646aa24677,0,6046,2,2016-04-15 14:25:41.026725,

Next come what experts call efforts to avoid infection – reductions of air travel and consumption of numerous mass services like transport  tourism  or retail shopping. / The financial damage caused by the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa that has already killed around three thousand people  is on track to set record losses.  “The most comprehensive estimate that I’ve seen was from the World Bank and they’ve estimated that it’s been between $2.2 and $7.4 bln just for 2014  and that could increase to an additional $1.6 or even 25.2 bln through 2015 ” Chris Pardee  Manager of Health Intelligence at iJET International said.  The bulk of uncertainty applies to people’s unpredictable emotions  as fear  or what economists call aversion behavior  deals the strongest blow to the tiny nation’s economy  spreading economic pain beyond the direct cost of treating the virus.  But let’s take pure facts. As of early November  nearly half of those working in Liberia were no longer working  says the most recent round of mobile phone surveys conducted by the World Bank Group  the Liberian Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services and the Gallup Organization. Those engaged in self-employment activities have been the hardest hit. Only about 36 percent of previously self-employed workers outside of agriculture and about half of those originally engaged in wage labor were still working since the crisis unfolded. In October only  Liberia saw a 40 percent spike in imported rice prices. Nevertheless  over 70 percent of respondents said that regardless of price  they did not have enough money to afford food.  “The report actually focuses on Liberia  but I think this is true for all three of the affected countries. What we’ve seen is kind of a general slowdown – people aren’t working  there’re travel restrictions  goods and services can’t be provided  things can’t move ” Kristen Himelein  Senior Economist at the World Bank Group and the report’s author said.  The most recent data from World Bank Group says that the two-year regional financial impact is about to reach $32.6 bln by the end of next year  in case the killer virus continues to surge in the three worst-affected states and spreads to neighboring regions. But it only remains to be seen whether one of the deadliest viruses known to man is going to be one of the most high priced as well.

Also read: Defence chiefs explore ways of curbing Ebola  He was speaking on Monday ahead of a new ECA report that explores the impact of the 13 241 cases identified and 4 950 deaths reported in the region since the outbreak earlier this year.  While the Ebola outbreaks in both Nigeria and Senegal officially ended in October 2014 and both countries declared free of Ebola  the disease is raging in Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone.  The ECA report raises the alarm on the risk of a rise in mortality of diseases not related to Ebola and also points out the wider impacts of the virus on the livelihoods of those affected.  Educational systems  rising social stigma  unemployment  and decreased food security are some of the big issues that Ebola-affected countries must deal with  according to the report.  Despite the alarm  Carlos called for a careful and cautious approach to the response.  - CAJ News  ,ebola-eae849b41b4657fd1170faac2fbf06e878d51ba04c61adb0f8ef362484fdb6ef,0,1308,1,2016-04-15 14:37:11.227720,

Governments reckon the worst of those effects are yet to be felt  but they are still busy trying to calculate what the outbreak is going to cost them. Here are Liberia’s thoughts:  The tiny post-conflict country has been growing at upwards of 8% over the last couple of years  but won’t expect anything like that kind of luck now. The government is still number-crunching with the International Monetary Fund  but it reckons Ebola will shave more than 2% of growth rates this year  putting estimates at 3.5%.  Finance minister Amara Konneh says that’s mostly because of damage done to mining  agriculture and service industries  as investors evacuate foreign workers  borders close  and international flights are suspended. Bread-basket regions are under quarantine  making agricultural trade impossible. Sime Darby  the world’s largest listed producer of oil palm  is slowing production and Sifca Group  an Ivory Coast-based agribusiness  has halted rubber exports. Mr Konneh expects iron ore exports to fall in 2015 because investors like China Union and ArcelorMittal are scaling down their operations and putting expansion plans on hold. Foreign exchange shortages are a big concern.  The finance ministry is bracing itself for up to $30m in lost revenues; a “significant” amount  it says  in the context of its meagre budget. Add to that the high cost of fighting the virus  and the country will run up a big fiscal deficit  even in light of international assistance. The government is putting in place fiscal austerity measures to compensate for that  including suspending all official foreign travel. But it may still may have to turn to the IMF for additional help.  Right now  Mr Konneh says  the priority is that the government allocates enough money to the healthcare sector. After that  it worries about paying its public servants. Security to enforce quarantines and curfews comes next.

This has created a labor shortage and will likely result in low levels of production on cash crops such as palm oil  cocoa and rubber. âSuch a decline in both food and cash crop production would severely impact household incomes  thus reducing purchasing power and inhibiting food access âa âspecial alertâ from the U.N agency says.  So far  more than 1 500 people have died from Ebola  and public health officials have started to restrict movement of people and establish quarantine zones. While these measures may help stop the fatal virus from spreading  economists fear what it will mean for the regionâs economy  which is highly dependent on agriculture.   âAlthough necessary  these restrictions have resulted in food security concerns that curtailed the movement of goods and services  including food items  leading to panic buying  food shortages  and significant price hikes â the report says.   Earlier this year  analysts predicted good harvests thanks to rainfall levels in most parts of these countries. But as harvest season approaches  workers in these areas are far from their typical routines  which will aggravate already high food prices.   U.N. data shows that nearly 80 percent of household income is spent on food in some cases  which means the price increase could seriously affect peopleâs access to the necessities. In Liberia  for example  the price of the staple food cassava increased up to 150 percent in just the first two weeks of August  according to U.N. data.   ,ebola-09d38160235540f8048485a0dd98997667b1b55cdaf7b8694077328d69ef61c8,43,2648,2,2016-04-15 14:40:06.376296,

Nearly 2 500 people had died there from the disease by mid October  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  There have been only three diagnosed cases of Ebola in the U.S. â none in New York. But while the outbreak has largely been limited to West Africa  local communities are feeling the effects of this disease in other ways.  For example  Brown recently started sending back about $300 a monthÂ â double what he used to â and heâs fundraising for the Staten Island Liberians Ebola Fund.  Brown says basic items have become much more expensive in Liberia and members of his family there are staying home from work. Which means they aren't earning  and they need his support.  âMy cousins who cannot go out in the street to sell water definitely are calling me on a daily basis  [saying ] âOh uncle Telee  how am I going to make it? I donât have food ââ he says.  But coming up with extra money each month for family members in Liberia  is making things tight for Brown and his family in New York.  âIt makes me reduce the amount of milk that I used to drink â he says. âIf I maybe ate three times a day  I have to save on a meal and eat two times a day.â  Those kinds of cutbacks can have ripple effects in the local economy.  Brown has reduced his visits to an outdoor market that sells traditional West African food like hot sauces and cooked meats.  âNobody got money to buy food here to eat â says vendor Sonnie Selma  explaining that many regular customers are sending all their money back to family members. She says now sheâs worried about paying rent.  But itâs not just the lack of money thatâs keeping people away.  Solomon Reeves  a child care specialist whoâs been fundraising to send money and medical supplies back to Liberia  says thereâs also a lot of fear about who might have traveled to West Africa recently.  âBecause of the Ebola  people donât really come [to the market] the way they used to come here â he says. âTheyâre afraid.â  Before he came to the market  Reeves said his wife told him to be careful; he noticed recently that a friend didnât want to shake his hand; and there have been a couple of reports of Liberians being told to stay home from work.  The entire Liberian community here is suffering economically and socially because of this disease  even though the closest diagnosed case is well over a thousand miles away.  ,ebola-3541c3d6c09cc320eb360d6c18fab1ad9879b1ef780ec17ad4a6af781cc87777,0,2856,0,2016-04-15 14:41:36.367318,

One thing that has received little attention is the impactof the unprecedented Ebola epidemic on the area's economy.  A report by the World Bank suggests thefollowing:  Short-term impact on theeconomy (2014):  Guinea - growth reducedfrom 4.5 percent to 2.1 percent Liberia - growth reducedfrom 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent Sierra Leone - growthreduced from 11.3 percent to 8.0 percent  In total  $359 millionworth of output will be lost during 2014 by all three nations combined.  If the epidemic is notcontained by the end of December 2014  a scenario that appears to be quitelikely  there will be a medium-term impact on the economies of all threenations for the calendar year 2015.  The World Bank ran two scenarios; a"Low Ebola" scenario where there is rapid containment in the threecore nations and a "High Ebola" scenario where the containment in thethree core nations is slower and the epidemic spreads to a wider region and for a longer period of time.  Here is a chart showingthe medium-term impact on the economy for both Low and High Ebola scenarios inpercentage points of GDP:     In total  the negativeimpact to GDP for the three nations in 2015 is expected to be $97 million underLow Ebola and $890 million under High Ebola.  In this posting  I'mgoing to focus on the impact of the Ebola epidemic on Liberia  the nation thathas suffered the most deaths thus far.

In the first half of this year the economy grew at a 11.3 percent annual pace; in the second half it has contracted at a 2.8 percent rate.  Averaged out  the country will achieve just 4.0 percent growth this year  and is expected to shrink 2.0 percent in 2015. Gross domestic product could lose $900 million fall next year  the report said.  Food production will fall because planting was curtailed in the June-August period; on top of that  heavy rains in September hit the country’s rice crop. Equally devastating has been the plunge in iron ore prices  which has hit the country’s main export.  In Guinea  growth slowed from a 4.5 percent pre Ebola pace to 0.5 percent in the second half  and the economy will likely contract 0.2 percent next year  according to the World Bank.  “Commerce and services have been hit by a sharp drop in international travel and regional trade; agricultural and manufacturing exports to neighboring countries have come to a standstill ” the report said.  World Bank President Jim Yong Kim  starting a two day trip to the affected region on Tuesday  said in a statement that the goal remains to reduce the number of Ebola cases to zero.  “While there are signs of progress  as long as the epidemic continues  the human and economic impact will only grow more devastating.”  Share this story,ebola-336dc16dd12a218acba6babe20a0dcfdfd1239db4a29fe96d7d8f56d03d21fd9,0,3430,2,2016-05-10 15:50:01.715682, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,131,Countries affected most by ebola,10019,After nearly  3 000 confirmed deaths and with the possibility that between 550 000 and  1.4 million people could be infected by early next year  the current Ebola epidemic has severely undermined the West African economies of Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone. While the economic loss related to the outbreak is incomparable to the tragic human loss  serious concerns are mounting about the growing economic toll of Ebola on the three countries.  Before the Ebola outbreak  the economies of Sierra Leone and Liberia had been steadily improving following long years of civil war. According to the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom  a global economic policy guidebook published annually by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal  the two post-conflict nations improved in the rankings of economic freedom and moved out of the economic freedom classification of “repressed.” Undergoing political unrest over the past decade marked by military coups  Guinea’s progress toward greater economic freedom had been uneven but charted upward over the past two years.  Wiping out much of the economic progress made over the past years  unfortunately  Ebola’s spread may well be “catastrophic” to these countries as warned by the World Bank. Beyond the immediate economic cost to contain the epidemic  there are serious indirect and long-term economic consequences  including “forgone output; higher fiscal deficits; rising prices; lower real household incomes and worsening poverty.”  Growth estimates for Guinea have been halved from 4.5 percent to 2.4 percent. The country has already experienced an exodus of farm workers  critical to key products such as cocoa and palm oil. For Sierra Leone  a country often cited as one of the fastest growing economies in Africa with an annual growth rate of over 11 percent  the projected economic growth has dropped to just 8 percent in 2014 and zero in 2015. The country has experienced a substantial slow-down in critical mining operations.  In the hardest hit country of all  Liberia  the World Bank revised its 2014 growth projection from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent. The bank reports that the country could experience a negative growth rate in 2015. Accelerating the economic downturn  Liberia’s two largest mining companies have already suspended operations as a result of the outbreak.  Unquestionably  the outbreak needs to be halted to ensure that no additional lives are lost first and foremost. However  the pace at which Ebola has subsumed the region is alarming  and even more concerning is how the three most affected countries will pull themselves out of the economic downturn caused by the ongoing Ebola epidemic.  As Jim Yong Kim  President of the World Bank  and Harvard University professor Paul Farmer pointed out in their joint op-ed:  We are at a dangerous moment in these three West African countries  all fragile states that have had strong economic growth in recent years after decades of wars and poor governance. It would be scandalous to let this crisis escalate further when we have the knowledge  tools and resources to stop it. Tens of thousands of lives  the future of the region and hard-won economic and health gains for millions hang in the balance.  No doubt that swift response to infectious disease at the scale of the current Ebola outbreak must be taken far more seriously than in the past. The tardy and paltry response to Ebola both in Africa and the West is no longer acceptable.  Print,ebola-2d52c7dcfdd0d16d20150546fe1da0328140f20145c7bb9fc8a22c7746f4e164,0,3469,0,2016-05-10 15:54:56.910394, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,131,Countries affected most by ebola,10022,An empty street market in Monrovia's West Point district  20 August 2014.  2 September 2014  Rome - Disruptions in food trade and marketing in the three West African countries most affected by Ebola have made food increasingly expensive and hard to come by  while labor shortages are putting the upcoming harvest season at serious risk  FAO warned today. In Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone  quarantine zones and restrictions on people's movement aimed at combating the spread of the virus  although necessary  have seriously curtailed the movement and marketing of food. This has lead to panic buying  food shortages and significant food price hikes on some commodities  especially in urban centers  according to a special alert issued today by FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS).  At the same time  the main harvest season for two key crops - rice and maize - is just weeks away. Labor shortages on farms due to movement restrictions and migration to other areas will seriously impact farm production  jeopardizing the food security of large numbers of people  the alert says.  Generally adequate rains during the 2014 cropping season had previously pointed to likely favorable harvests in the main Ebola-affected countries. But now food production - the areas most affected by the outbreak are among the most productive in Sierra Leone and Liberia - stands to be seriously scaled back.  Likewise  production of cash crops like palm oil  cocoa and rubber - on which the livelihoods and food purchasing power of many families depend - is expected to be seriously affected.  "Access to food has become a pressing concern for many people in the three affected countries and their neighbors " said Bukar Tijani  FAO Regional Representative for Africa. "With the main harvest now at risk and trade and movements of goods severely restricted  food insecurity is poised to intensify in the weeks and months to come. The situation will have long-lasting impacts on farmers' livelihoods and rural economies " he added.  Major spikes in food prices Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone are all net cereal importers  with Liberia being the most reliant on external supplies. The closure of some border crossings and the isolation of border areas where the three countries intersect - as well as reduced trade from seaports  the main conduit for large-scale commercial imports - are resulting in tighter supplies and sharply increasing food prices.  In Monrovia  Liberia  a recently conducted rapid market assessment indicates that prices of some food items have increased rapidly - for example  in Monrovia's Redlight Market the price of cassava went up 150 percent within the first weeks of August.  "Even prior to the Ebola outbreak  households in some of the affected areas were spending up to 80 percent of their incomes on food " said Vincent Martin  Head of FAO's Dakar-based Resilience Hub  which is coordinating the agency's response. "Now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach. This situation may have social repercussions that could lead to subsequent impact on the disease containment."  The depreciation of national currencies in Sierra Leone and Liberia in recent months is expected to exert further upward price pressure on imported food commodities. Response efforts To meet short-term food relief needs  the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has launched a regional emergency operation targeting some 65 000 tonnes of food to 1.3 million people.  At the same time  FAO's special alert says that "rapid assessments are required to identify the type of measures that are feasible to mitigate the impact of labour shortages during the harvesting period and for related post-harvest activities."  And measures to revive internal trade are essential to ease supply constraints and mitigate further food price increases  it notes.  Preventing further loss of human life and stopping the spread of the virus remain the top priorities at this time. FAO has joined the coordinated UN effort to support affected countries  is in daily communication with WHO and other key actors  and has personnel in West Africa aiding technical and logistical efforts.  It is critical that rural communities understand which practices pose the highest risks of human-to-human transmission as well as the potential spill-over from wildlife. Toward that end  FAO has activated its networks of local animal health clubs  community animal health workers  producer organizations  forestry contacts and agriculture extension and rural radio services to help UNICEF and WHO communicate risk to affected populations.  This press release can be viewed online at: http://www.einpresswire.com  Disclaimer: If you have any questions regarding information in this press release please contact the company listed in the press release.

Gross domestic product could lose US$900 million fall next year  the report said.  Food production will fall because planting was curtailed in the June-August period; on top of that  heavy rains in September hit the country's rice crop. Equally devastating has been the plunge in iron ore prices  which has hit the country's main export. In Guinea  growth slowed from a 4.5 per cent pre-Ebola pace to 0.5 per cent in the second half  and the economy will likely contract 0.2 per cent next year  according to the World Bank.  "Commerce and services have been hit by a sharp drop in international travel and regional trade; agricultural and manufacturing exports to neighbouring countries have come to a standstill " the report said. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim  starting a two-day trip to the affected region on Tuesday  said in a statement that the goal remains to reduce the number of Ebola cases to zero. "While there are signs of progress  as long as the epidemic continues  the human and economic impact will only grow more devastating."  -  ,ebola-959f9983ccce53d5ce35cb2df4ace85000a92d90645d4f1bca0a51eda864c44f,0,3148,0,2016-05-10 16:03:41.815323,

All rights reserved. This material may not be published  broadcast  rewritten or redistributed. 38.8951-77.0364 WASHINGTON (AP) — Just as their economies had begun to recover from the man-made horror of coups and civil war  the West African nations of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone have been knocked back down by a terrifying force of nature: the Ebola virus.  In addition to the human toll — more than 4 000 dead so far — the outbreak has paralyzed economic life. Across the Ebola zone  shops are closed  hotels vacant  flights cancelled  fields untended  investments on hold.  In Conakry  capital of Guinea  stray dogs  goats and sheep are plopping down next to empty stalls in street markets devoid of shoppers.  About the only things people want to buy are products meant to guard against Ebola — antiseptic gels and devices that attach to faucets and add chlorine to the water.  "These are selling like bread at the market " said Cece Loua  who sells pharmaceutical products in Conakry.  The World Bank has dramatically downgraded its expectations for economic growth this year in the three countries hardest hit by the outbreak. Guinea will grow 2.4 percent  down from a previously forecast 4.5 percent  it predicts; Liberia 2.5 percent  down from 5.9 percent; and Sierra Leone 8 percent  down from 11.3 percent.  "It's been really devastating " said Rosa Whitaker  CEO of the consultancy the Whitaker Group and a former U.S. trade official.  It's an especially cruel turn for three impoverished economies that had been making steady progress after years of devastating conflict:  — In Sierra Leone  which endured a civil war from 1991 to 2002 that killed 70 000 and left 2.6 million homeless  the economy surged 20 percent last year and 15 percent in 2012.  — Liberia  which lost 250 000 people to civil wars from 1989 to 2003  has recorded double-digit economic growth four of the past five years.  — Guinea  with a history of bloody coups and political strife  has grown more slowly (2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2012)  but had expected its economy to accelerate as foreign companies invested in such projects as the Simandou iron ore mine.  "No one could have imagined the extent of the economic and social turnaround " said Steven Radelet  a foreign aid expert at Georgetown University and an adviser to the Liberian government. "The past 10 years  there's been remarkable progress  and a lot of investors coming in."  Ebola has frozen the economic revival.  "They were coming back and now have been set back in a big way " said Francisco Ferreira  the World Bank's chief economist for Africa.  The epidemic damages the economy directly. Commerce stops. The sick can't work. Contaminated areas close down. Tax collections dry up. Health care costs swell  squeezing governments already struggling with expenses.  But the indirect damage can be even worse as fear paralyzes Ebola-stricken communities.  "People are obviously very afraid of it " Ferreira said. "People stay home and don't consume... Flights are being canceled because no one wants to go there. Hotels are firing people because no one is staying there."  Liberia canceled soccer games because it's "a contact sport  and Ebola is spread through sweat " said Musa Bility  president of the Liberia Football Association. The suspension of sporting events has hurt Boima Folley's sporting goods shop in the Liberian capital Monrovia.  "No one comes to even ask for — let alone buy — sports materials these days " he said.  Analysts are at least optimistic that the economic damage from the crisis can be contained to the hardest-hit countries. The three Ebola-stricken nations are  after all  economically small  and their troubles are unlikely to disrupt commerce beyond their borders: Combined  their three economies amount to half the size of Vermont's.  Last week  the International Monetary Fund forecast that the 25 African countries it has grouped as "low-income"— including the three most hit by Ebola — would register a combined 6.3 percent economic growth this year  faster than the 6.1 percent in 2013.  One factor in Africa's favor: Nigeria  West Africa's dominant economy  and Senegal moved decisively to identify and isolate Ebola victims and those who had come into contact with them.  "We're incredibly impressed by the ability of Nigeria and Senegal to keep their epidemics contained " Ferreira said.  The World Bank still fears a worst-case scenario in which Ebola breaks out of three countries and spreads across West Africa. Under that scenario  economic losses across West Africa would rise as high as $32.6 billion this year and next  up from no more than $9 billion if the disease were contained.  Continent-wide  Africa has made significant strides. Six of the world's fastest-growing economies are in Africa  the White House reported at an August U.S.-Africa Summit meant to celebrate the continent's rise.  Most analysts think Africa's overall economy will continue to expand. The momentum remains strong  and damage from Ebola still seems likely to be contained.  "I don't think there will be lasting damage " said Anna Rosenberg  head of Frontier Strategy Group's sub-Saharan Africa practice. "The growth story coming out of sub-Saharan Africa is too big and too real to be ignored. There's nothing that is going to stop it going forward."  ___  Diallo reported from Conakry  Guinea.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,131,Countries affected most by ebola,10034,WASHINGTON  October 8  2014–With the latest death toll from Ebola now at 3 439 in the three worst-affected countries of Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone  a new economic impact assessment from the World Bank Group says that if the epidemic was to significantly infect people in neighboring countries  some of which have much larger economies  the two-year regional financial impact could reach US$32.6 billion by the end of 2015.  The new World Bank Group report notes  “as it is far from certain that the epidemic will be fully contained by December 2014 and in light of the considerable uncertainty about its future trajectory  two alternative scenarios are used to estimate the medium-term (2015) impact of the epidemic  extending to the end of calendar year 2015.”  A “Low Ebola” scenario corresponds to rapid containment within the three most severely affected countries  while “High Ebola” corresponds to slower containment in the three countries  with broader regional contagion.  According to the World Bank Group’s new analysis  the economic impacts of Ebola are already very serious in the core three countries – particularly Liberia and Sierra Leone – and could become catastrophic under a slow-containment  High Ebola scenario. In broader regional terms  the economic impact could be limited if immediate national and international action stop the epidemic and alleviate the “aversion behavior” or fear factor that is causing neighboring countries to close their borders  and airlines and other regional and international companies to suspend their commercial activities in the three worst-affected countries. The successful containment of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal so far is evidence that this is possible  given some existing health system capacity and a resolute policy response.  “With Ebola’s potential to inflict massive economic costs on Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone and the rest of their neighbors in West Africa  the international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff  more hospital beds  and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks ” says Jim Yong Kim  the President of the World Bank Group.    “,ebola-d5178e23444789c5426cbe77762e3236f36547ea5431dc3853f99c2e148eed7d,0,2229,2,2016-05-10 16:15:55.272349,

Simandou  in the forests of eastern Guinea  is Africa's largest iron ore mine and infrastructure project. Vale  the world's biggest iron ore producer  was involved in Simandou until April. It evacuated six international members of staff and put the rest of the workforce in the area on leave.

SmelterSteelmakers and miners have been hit by the outbreak A smaller British company  London Mining  has moved out some its non-essential expatriate staff from Sierra Leone  where mining has accounted for much of the country's recent growth. According to the International Monetary Fund  Sierra Leone's output grew by 20% last year; excluding iron ore mining  it grew by 5.5%.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,132,Companies affected most by ebola,2126,New York - Mining companies are acting swiftly to keep the Ebola virus at bay  screening employees and restricting access to remote mining camps while production ticks over in the iron ore and gold fields of West Africa.  A prolonged outbreak  however  will threaten mineral production in Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea if essential supplies are disrupted and employees stay away from work too long.  Or worse: should a miner or family member contract the deadly virus.  Force majeure  Steel and mining company ArcelorMittal on Friday announced force majeure on a project that is planned to triple its iron ore production in Liberia because of the Ebola epidemic sweeping West Africa.  ArcelorMittal  which mines and ships 5 million tonnes of iron ore a year in Liberia  has been working on an expansion project that would increase shipments to 15 million tonnes of iron ore.  First production from the new project is planned by the end of next year. However  contractors working on the project have declared force majeure and were moving people out of the country  ArcelorMittal said.  Declarations of force majeure are used to prevent companies from being sued when extraordinary circumstances beyond their control prevent the fulfilment of contractual obligations.  Taking stock  The company is assessing the impact on the project schedule and hoped to restart work as soon as possible. It added the force majeure only affects the new project and other operations in Yekepa and Buchanan are continuing as normal.  "While the recent developments are very concerning  at present we believe that the emergency procedures and other measures developed and currently in place at all ArcelorMittal sites in Liberia make it possible to continue our phase 1 operations " Bill Scotting  chief executive of ArcelorMittal Mining  said.  In common with other mining companies in the region  ArcelorMittal has enforced measures to try to prevent Ebola's spread.  ArcelorMittal  listed on stock exchanges including New York  Amsterdam  Paris and Luxembourg  is one of the world's five largest producers of iron ore and metallurgical coal.  In 2013  ArcelorMittal had revenue of $79.4bn and crude steel production of 91.2 million tonnes  while own iron ore production reached 58.4 million tonnes.  The potential to impact businesses  "I think everyone is mindful that it's something that has the potential to impact businesses " said Mark Bristow  chief executive of Randgold Resources Ltd  which mines gold in Mali  across the border from Guinea.  Though it has no mines in countries affected thus far  Randgold is among several miners in West Africa to have launched preventive measures against an outbreak that has killed more than 900 people in four countries.  The World Health Organisation has called the epidemic an "extraordinary event" that constitutes an international health risk. There is no known cure for Ebola  which is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids.  The outbreak began in eastern Guinea in February  before spreading to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cases have also been recorded in Nigeria.  Not a single case of Ebola has been recorded among the employees of those companies mining and exploring large reserves of oil  iron ore  bauxite and gold in the region. But some have sent workers home and scaled back or suspended exploration.  Other firm's respond  Australia-listed Tawana Resources NL  which is developing the Mofe Creek iron ore project 20 km (12 miles) from the Liberian coast  said on Friday it was halting non-essential field work. Its stock fell nearly 19 percent.  "What we have seen now  because of the movements of non-essential personnel  is that exploration activity is starting to be curtailed " said Paul Renken  analyst at VSA Capital  an investment bank focused on natural resources.  Canadian Overseas Petroleum Ltd  ExxonMobil Corp's partner in a venture to explore the Block LB-13 project off the coast of Liberia  has said that drilling will be delayed due to the "reduced presence of expatriates".  Some miners  including Sierra Rutile Ltd and African Minerals Ltd  are screening staff for early signs of the virus and running community education programmes.  AngloGold Ashanti is also controlling the movement of workers to and from its Siguiri gold mine in Guinea  only 25 km from the town of the same name  where cases have been reported  said company spokesperson Chris Nthite.  But it will be difficult  if not impossible  for mining companies throughout West Africa to restrict the movement of their employees indefinitely.  "If the situation goes on for another two or three months  then I think we should start to expect problems " said John Meyer  a mining analyst at brokerage SP Angel.  He said this would be particularly true in the event that Ebola were to afflict communities that serve the mines  "because the mines will want to cut themselves off  but the families will want to be with their breadwinners".  ,ebola-a6b8a6b84c2a404caa20b1f841cec4801839110158528928a639e6aa0e699c29,0,4981,2,2016-04-18 11:06:01.635534,

"It's business as usual at the site  but obviously we are monitoring the situation " he said.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,132,Companies affected most by ebola,2150,The London-listed company at the centre of coordinating efforts to fight the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone has gone bust.  London Mining  which employs 1 400 people at its iron ore mine in Marampa  120 miles east of the capital Freetown  and is building an Ebola treatment centre  appointed administrators on Thursday after failing to find a buyer for the severely debt-laden firm.  The collapse of the company raises fears about international efforts to combat Ebola  which has claimed about 4 500 lives in Sierra Leone  Guinea and Liberia.  London Mining is building a 130-bed Ebola treatment centre near Lunsar  60 miles east of Freetown  and has donated Le 709m (Â£103 000) to Sierra Leoneâs efforts to fight the spread of the disease.  There are also fears about the increased risk to London Miningâs staff if the mine ceases operations. At present  all staff have their temperature checked twice a day  and medical staff are on hand to address any concerns. None of the companyâs employees have yet contracted the disease.  London Mining and its administrators said they would do all they could to keep the mine going while they search for a buyer  but said âalthough at this time this is not confirmedâ.  Dan Desjardins  London Miningâs managing director  who has been central to coordinating efforts to fight the spread of Ebola  said on 8 October: âWe are part of this community and this nation. A strengthened healthcare system is essential for safeguarding the health of our employees and our host communities .  âWe believe it is our duty to provide what help we can to stem the spread of this disease.â  The heavily-indebted company  which has been pushed to the brink by collapsing iron prices combined with the difficulty of working through the Ebola crisis  is one of Sierra Leoneâs biggest employers and contributes about 10% of the nationâs GDP.  The administrator  PwC  said the company has already held âadvanced discussionsâ with several potential buyers  and âit is hoped these discussions will mean that a sale of Marampa can now be concluded quickly  with operations continuing and the workforce protectedâ.  Russell Downs  joint administrator and partner at PwC said: âThe collapse in iron ore prices and the resulting impacts on this business have been very dramatic. Our focus is to ensure that a buyer is found for the Marampa mine operations given it is such an important part of the Sierra Leone economy. We are liaising with key stakeholders and asking for a short window of forbearance as we look to conclude a transaction.â  Graeme Hossie  London Miningâs chief executive  said: âI salute all our employees for their dedication and contribution in creating what is now an important part of Sierra Leoneâs economy and ongoing development.  âI also applaud them for the ongoing leadership role our team has played within the private sector in Sierra Leone in helping address the challenges of the current Ebola crisis. The Marampa mine retains excellent fundamentals and it is our sincere wish for it to find the appropriate financial support to continue operating over the longer term.â  London Mining  which has been operating in Sierra Leone since 2005  suspended trading in its shares on 10 October after warning that it did not have enough cash to continue to run the mine. The shares  which had traded above Â£4 in 2011  were suspended at 0.75p valuing the company at just Â£1m.  Potential buyers for the company include Indiaâs third-largest steelmaker  JSW Steel  and Frank Timis  the founder of African Minerals  which owns a neighbouring mine.  Standard Chartered  the companyâs biggest lender  had already hired PwC to negotiate with potential bidders.  London Mining has warned that the Ebola outbreak could cost it an additional $1 per tonne of iron ore produced.  Liberiaâs finance minister  Amara Konneh  warned on Thursday that the Ebola crisis would stall the countries economy for at least the next year. âGrowth is expected to be 0% for 2015 â he said in an interview with Monrovia-based Front Page Africa.  Konnehâs prediction is worse than the latest World Bank estimate of 2.5%  down from the previous projection of 5.9%.  Konneh said Ebola has âseriously affected economic activities and livelihoods throughout the country with domestic food production  mining activities  hospitality industry  and transport services all decliningâ.  The Ebola crisis has caused billionaire Lakshmi Mittalâs steel empire ArcelorMittal to delay expansion of its iron-ore mine in the country and Malaysian giant Sime Darby has reduced its Liberian palm oil operations.  ,ebola-a5b51a8f76a892b4707efeded8c0defdd065a3ad82f61550845322a7a0377efb,0,4670,2,2016-04-18 11:17:55.229288,

The quarantine  however  has made it almost impossible to get enough food to the capital  Freetown. Thousands of workers such as Sesay sit at home. (Richard Evans  a spokesman for mining contractor Dawnus  confirmed that a âlarge numberâ of staff had been furloughed with pay and says Sesayâs complaint is the first heâs heard of anyone not receiving money.) From Freetownâs hilly streets overlooking the Gulf of Guinea  residents spend their days in their houses worrying about costs for food and fuel  which are rising despite government promises to crack down on price gougers.  Liberia has banned public gatherings and told nonessential civil servants to stay home. The government is even planning to close open-air markets  a measure that will probably push up prices in the capital  Monrovia. At the crowded Duala market in the city center  food seller Mary Kolubah says business has slowed. The wholesale shop where she buys bags of rice to resell in smaller  paper-wrapped quantities raised prices by 10 percent recently  she says. Nearby  meat seller Amadu Bah  46  sits idle at his empty stall. Traders from Guinea and Sierra Leone cannot bring their cattle across the border region  the area hardest hit by the disease. âIâm out of business now â he says  âbecause selling cow meat is the only thing Iâve known since I was 25 years old.â  This marks the first time the disease  identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo  has killed anyone in West Africa. The virus struck just as the three countries were starting to bounce back from a past of violence and instability. Liberia is recovering from a civil war that spilled into neighbor Sierra Leone during the 1990s  leaving both economies ruined. In 2010  Guinea  the worldâs biggest bauxite exporter  held its first democratic elections since independence  following decades of erratic military rule. The health crisis has been compounded by a distrust of government rooted in the three countriesâ unstable past: Officials are still struggling to convince locals that Ebola exists and isnât a hoax.  ,ebola-23a5452a89d104d5bcf0bf1e5c65acb059dfc23bfc95bd24308c2c204dfa1863,0,2537,2,2016-04-18 11:19:46.369248,

Unfortunately  with mining stocks and the Ebola virus itâs hard to tell which is which. We analyze the impact of Ebola on the mining industry.  In March 2014  the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a major Ebola outbreak in Guinea  the first of its kind in the region. While only transmitted via bodily fluids and not nearly as contagious as airborne-illnesses like SARS or the avian flu  over 1 100 people have died in West Africa because of the disease.  With fear mongering in the press about a âglobal pandemicâ  this is sparking unnecessary volatility in stocks with exposure to the region.  Make no mistake: There are real economic consequences to the disease and the way companies react to it. But it is up to investors to discern the genuine threats from the media-induced hysteria.  Assessing the impact of Ebola on mines  Affected countries Liberia  Guinea and Sierra Leone house vast natural resources miners seek to tap. Although there havenât been any Ebola cases reported at any mines yet  many companies are taking precautions. On Friday August 8  Tawana Resources  an Australian miner developing an iron ore project off the Liberian coast  said it was halting non-essential fieldwork. Its stock dropped almost 19 percent as a result.  Non-essential fieldwork is not the same as shutting down production. Did Tawana deserve that kind of slide? Or what about African Minerals  an iron ore miner based in Sierra Leone? In the space of two weeks its shares have been cut in half in part because of Ebola concerns  even though the company announced on August 6 that none of its workers had it and production,ebola-65147d0c9a450b4f10e28aaf7d12a2e6e23cb11f253f01df300eda02203101d6,0,1700,2,2016-04-18 11:20:18.139467,

Five new suspected infections were reported in the last 24 hours  the UN's World Health Organisation (WHO)  bringing the total to 127.  Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has warned of an unprecedented epidemic that is testing weak health systems across West Africa. Suspected cases of one of the world's most lethal infectious diseases have also been reported in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The epicentre of Guinea's two-month old outbreak has been in the southeast  close to its main iron ore reserves.The country is also the world's top exporter of bauxite  the raw material used in aluminium production  and has rich deposits gold.  "Everyone is practising precautionary strict hygiene but there has been no real impact on production so far " a senior executive at a mining company told Reuters  asking not to be named.  The executive said he had been placed on extended leave  while other companies were preventing people from entering or leaving their mines.  Miners concerned about Conakry Firms were more concerned by what was happening in the densely populated capital Conakry than in remote mining sites in the interior  where controls were easier to put in place  he added.  The WHO has reported 12 suspected cases and four deaths in the ocean-front city of 2-million people. WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl said all the cases in Conakry were linked to one man who came from the central Guinean town of Dobala  about 300 km away.  "Unfortunately  this one person infected both family members and health care workers when he went to Conakry for medical attention and died " Hartl told Reuters in Geneva.  Brazilian iron ore miner Vale said its VBG joint venture with BSG Resources (BSGR) – the mining arm of Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz's business conglomerate – had pulled its six international staff out of Guinea.  "The expatriates have been transferred temporarily to their home countries " Vale said in an emailed statement in Brazil.  "The local employees ... have been given leave from work until there is more accurate information about the risks of the disease."  There has not been any official statement from the chamber of mines but the executive said mining firms had been calling each other to discuss the best response. "People are locking down camps and keeping movements to a minimum " the executive added.  Neighbouring Senegal has closed its land borders with Guinea  and countries across the region have taken precautionary measures  including banning the sale and consumption of bats  a regional delicacy but an animal believed to be a vector for the virus.  The British Foreign Office said on its website on Wednesday there were reports of suspected cases in Gambia.

Malac told the corporate group that teams from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization needed to get to southeastern Liberia  a largely undeveloped region of forests and rivers  far from most basic services. Finding safe accommodation posed a problem  and communications  transportation and logistics could also be difficult  she said.  The response was swift.  Within hours  David Rothschild  executive director of agribusiness firmÂ Golden Veroleum Liberia  which has palm oil operations in the countryâs southeast  offered housing he described as clean but ârudimentaryâ in two counties  Sinoe and Grand Kru.  William Cook  operations director of gold-mining companyHummingbird Resources  offered housing in a guest house with electricity and running water â rare amenities in the remote region â near the town of Greenville and in an exploration camp further inland.  In neighboring Sierra Leone  U.S. acting ambassador Kathleen Fitzgibbons cited the need for road grading and site preparation for an Ebola treatment center in the iron-ore producing town of Lunsar  which would be operated by theÂ International Medical Corps. Within hours Â London Mining  with heavy equipment available  came to the rescue  cutting weeks or more from the construction process.  The prompt corporate response is the result of a months-long preparatory process to coordinate actions that began with aggressive programs information and education programs. Since March  when the Ebola threat re-emerged in Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia  after a relatively small rural outbreak earlier in the year  companies with operations in the area had been preparing for an emerging crisis. By monthâs end  the disease had spread to Guineaâs capital Conakry and was on the move through Liberia.  ,ebola-8ec5de2d073baa0d17db41f139d3804ea355d6932a62dd32967f5b55d521ae48,0,2212,2,2016-04-18 11:39:08.019701,

The group  calling itself  the Ebola Private Sector Mobilization Group (EPSMG)  recently formed with the intent to support the Government of Liberia and the Liberian people during this time of crisis. Without a doubt  Ebola is a horrible disease and as such we are concerned with the public health and the affects and ramifications of a further spread. Our companies have made long-term commitments to stay in Liberia and support the government's effort to eradicate this disease  and we pledge to continue to support the people and communities in our areas â the group said in a statement. According to the statement  the group said it intends to honor commitment  adding containing the disease and assuring recovery from its impact will require an historic deployment of resources on unprecedented scale. EPSMG said it was formed in early August 2014  and continues to have strong ties to hundreds of local communities that depend on its operations and the economic stability provided by employing Liberians. Members institutions said: âDespite the challenging environment  we are continuing where possible with normal operations  with the health and safety of our employees being the absolute priority at all times.â As a group  they are in regular dialogue with each other  the government  NGOs  the United Nations Mission in Liberia  U.S. Forces  Liberia and other organizations involved to support and amplify the effort. We will work toward a strong  healthy and Ebola-free Liberia. EPSMG named its platform as: to remain in the region and be a part of the nation's long-term economic and social recovery and development; to ensure employees  families and communities are aware of the disease and are taking the best precautions to avoid infection and stigma; to share experiences and resources  including trained personnel and practices  to assist governments and partners to mobilize quickly to control the spread of the disease; to offer loan or gift-appropriate assets and resources essential to the deployment of an integrated response by donors  militaries  host governments  NGOs and community-based organizations; to make available information about needs of various organizations and first responders  so that they may be connected with corporate giving; to commit to learning from this outbreak and working together to support a strong healthcare system in the affected counties; to raise international awareness and advocate for a larger global coordinated effort to combat Ebola; and to advocate for open trade and humanitarian corridors by air  land and sea. Members of EPSMG include: African Mining Services  Kinkross  Alcoa  KRL International  ArcelorMittal  London Mining  Aureus Mining  MonuRent  BHP Billiton  Newcrest Mining  Chevron  Newmont  Dawnus  Pricewater-House Coopers  Diago  Putu Iron Ore  Equatarial Palm Oil  Rangold  Firestone  Rio Pinto  Golden Veroleum  Semato  Heineken  Shell  Hummingbird Resources  Tawana Resources  IAMGOLD Corporation  Teranga Gold  International Finance Corp and Western Cluster.  Tags:  ,ebola-4ed934111b9c67c02961e131719a341a16476b6f6a802460f7f975b154009342,0,3170,2,2016-05-10 16:11:46.102714,

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,133,Worldwide ebola impact,1603,WASHINGTON  September 17  2014—The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has stolen the lives of nearly 3 000 people since January 2014. In addition to lost lives  the disease is dealing a severe economic blow to families and governments. Closed borders and abandoned farms are driving up food costs leaving many people in rural communities hungry. Emergency spending on health services is drawing money from already cash-strapped government budgets. The epidemic could reverse years of economic gains made by countries in this developing part of the world.  Open Quotes Early estimates for growth in Guinea have been halved from 4.5% to 2.4% as a result of the disease.  Close Quotes  A new World Bank report outlines the short and medium-term toll the Ebola crisis could take on the three most heavily affected countries – Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone – if those countries and their partners don’t immediately ramp up efforts to contain the disease outbreak. Estimates of the impact on the three countries for 2015 range from $97 million (if the epidemic is rapidly contained) to $809 million (if control of the epidemic is delayed).    Guinea  The impact is already evident in Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone  the three countries with the highest number of Ebola cases. Early estimates for growth in Guinea have been halved from 4.5% to 2.4% as a result of the disease. Already among the poorest countries in West Africa with a population of 12 million  Guinea has seen the biggest losses in its agriculture industry. An exodus of farm workers from the countryside has meant lower exports of key products like cocoa and palm oil.  Sierra Leone  Sierra Leone  once navigating toward Middle Income status at an 11.3% annual growth rate could see growth of only 8% in 2014 and zero in 2015. The disease has spread to all but one of the country’s 13 districts  with four doctors and 30 nurses among the dead. The country has been devastated by restrictions on international travel  the closing of markets  disruption of farming activities and a slow-down in critical mining operations as a result of foreign workers fleeing the country for fear of contracting Ebola.  ,ebola-57aed64eeb4008e1488938e89e630fc871ea2be3599c5336e0b4adf386613a0d,0,2141,2,2016-04-15 14:18:03.773010, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,133,Worldwide ebola impact,1604,Most of the team members are “country economists” whose job is usually to monitor the macroeconomic situation in their assigned countries and to routinely feed these assessments to the rest of the Bank for designing or evaluating projects and programs.  Although I thought I knew the Bank pretty well from my 20 years in its Development Economics Research Group (1986-2006)  I gained a new appreciation of the skills of the country economists as I watched them gather and assemble tidbits of relevant data about how Ebola is affecting the economies of Liberia  Sierra Leone  and Guinea.     For example  the country economist for Liberia was able to gather data on cement sales (see Figure 1)  which tell the story of an exhilarating construction boom in 2013  very good news for a desperately poor economy recovering from years of civil war. Then around March of 2014 cement sales dove to mid-2013 levels.  Causality is murky  but it’s fair to ask whether this drop was a response to the discovery of the first West African Ebola case in neighboring Guinea.  The recovery of sales the following month to a level near the previous peak suggests that investors and construction contractors had shrugged off their worry  thinking that the outbreak had been contained.  But then in August  2014  as evidence accumulated that Ebola was out of control in Monrovia  cement sales plummeted to pre-boom levels.  Since WHO’s latest update shows Liberia’s epidemic continuing to grow  it seems likely that the last quarter of 2014 will see further collapses in cement sales  to levels below those of 2010.   ,ebola-c64fde2130b70f764b4d6326c0be7c959fbd4ca9950c50c90a380f81c38974ea,0,1598,2,2016-04-15 14:18:59.999326,

Thus  we have followed with growing sadness and dismay the stories of human suffering emanating from Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea in the context of the Ebola epidemic. These horrifying stories of the effect of Ebola in West Africa are now overshadowing continued good economic news from the rest of the continent.  About a month ago we were asked – together with a much larger team – to estimate the economic costs of the outbreak for the West Africa region. The report  titled “The Economic Impact of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic: Short and Medium Term Estimates for West Africa ” was released yesterday.  Although there is still great uncertainty about the Ebola epidemic  our task was to produce best-effort estimates of its macroeconomic and fiscal impact using the best tools immediately available.  But Ebola is quite different from standard shocks to developing countries  including slow-moving diseases like diabetes or hypertension. The standard approach to estimating economic impact of diseases is to compute the cost of medical care (the “direct” cost) and the loss of output from people who can’t work (the “indirect cost”).1 But given the rapid spread and high fatality rate of Ebola  this approach would not come close to capturing the third quarter 2014 impact already visible to the World Bank’s country teams.  Drawing on previous work on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  we posit that a rapidly- moving  often fatal disease elicits “aversion behavior ” as economic agents withdraw from commercial interaction  shun what they perceive to be exposed assets  and postpone or divert investment from affected economies. Since “aversion behavior” appears nowhere in our economic models  we assume that aversion behavior leads to the withdrawal or reduced utilization of certain percentages of both labor and capital and to increased transaction costs on both domestic and international economic transactions.  ,ebola-d0d98dbf4a806ce3d513c4bab7899660f7fb3b432e6cce51b7c24ce527c3b8e0,0,2117,2,2016-04-15 14:20:22.076170,

The analysis uses two alternative scenarios to estimate the medium-term impact of the epidemic to the end of calendar year 2015. A “Low Ebola” scenario envisions rapid containment within the three core countries  while “High Ebola” corresponds to the upper ranges of current epidemiological estimates.  Estimates of impacts on output individually and in aggregate   in the short term (2014) and medium term (2015)     Short Term Impact 2014  Medium-term impact  (2015 - Low Ebola)  Medium-term impact  (2015 - High Ebola)  Guinea  $130 million (2.1 pp)  - $43 million (1.0 pp)  $142 million (2.3 pp)  Liberia  $66 million (3.4 pp)  $82 million (4.2 pp)  $228 million (11.7 pp)  Sierra Leone  $163 million (3.3 pp)  $59 million (1.2 pp)  $439 million (8.9 pp)  Core Three Countries  $359 million  $97 million  $809 million  Entries are in current US dollars (with percentage points of GDP in brackets where appropriate).  The analysis estimates the short-term impact on output to be 2.1 percentage points of GDP in Guinea (reducing growth from 4.5 percent to 2.4 percent); 3.4 percentage points in Liberia (reducing growth from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent); and 3.3 percentage points in Sierra Leone (reducing growth from 11.3 percent to 8 percent). This forgone output corresponds to $359 million in 2014 prices.  However  if Ebola is not contained  these estimates rise to $809 million in the three countries alone. In Liberia  the hardest hit country  the High Ebola scenario sees output hit 11.7 percentage points in 2015 (reducing growth from 6.8 percent to -4.9 percent).  ,ebola-e40fb24d9d13c95850a7f96d75c1ac2ba9d461eaa3168b3a4d10a34ce1fa413e,0,2177,2,2016-04-15 14:22:25.164366,

[Reuters] There is not yet any macroeconomic analysis of Ebola's impact on West Africa  withÂ IMF figures only indicatingÂ a modest decrease inÂ growth for Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea. But NGOs on the ground describeÂ the situation as âcatastrophicâ.  Amara Konneh  Liberiaâs minister of finance  recently said that his country's projected gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2014 would need to be revised downwards from the 5.9% forecast  as a result of the crisis.  Reacting to a US$52 million (â¬40 million) grant provided by the World Bank  Konneh said the government needs about US$200 million (â¬156 million) to fight the Ebola epidemic  and bring Liberia out of recession.  According to the IMF  the projected growth rate could decline for Sierra Leone from 11.3% to 8%  for Liberia from 5.9% to 2.5% and for Guinea from 3.5% to 2.4%. The IMF admits that the situation is evolving  and that the crisis is not over yet. All the three countries are covered by IMF programs.  The reality on the ground appears to indicate that the IMF needs to revise its figures.  Meinie Nicolai  President of MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) Belgium  told EurActiv that the epidemic was havingÂ a major impact in the affected countries in Western Africa and called the situation catastrophic. She insisted that the international response to the emergency was âbelowÂ standardâ and âway too slowâ.  Nicolai  who just returned to Brussels from Liberia and Sierra Leone  said that it was important to remember that the epidemic Â wasÂ still spreading  that it is highly deadly  and that she could not predictÂ when it would be contained.  ,ebola-fb060893b902900722bc96849f94b6777ffa44e70cf8878dffbe9ae32462facc,0,1773,2,2016-04-15 14:38:14.553094, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,133,Worldwide ebola impact,1653,Johannesburg - The cost of the Ebola epidemic on Sub-Saharan Africa's economy is likely to be closer to $3-$4bn  rather than a worst case scenario of $32bn  the World Bank's chief economist for the continent said on Wednesday.  Francisco Ferreira told a lecture in Johannesburg that successful containment of Ebola in some West African countries made its gloomiest forecasts less likely  although economic damage could still escalate if there was any complacency.  "The risk of the highest case of economic impact of Ebola has been reduced because of the success of containment in some countries. It has not gone to zero because a great level of preparedness and focus is still needed " Ferreira said.  "I would say the outlook has moved closer to the lower case of $3-$4bn  than the upper case ($32bn) " he added.  Ferreira said  however  that the Ebola crisis had already ravaged tourism in Africa because the "fear factor" kept visitors away from countries even where there had been no cases of the virus  like Kenya and South Africa.  In a report in October on the possible economic impact of the Ebola epidemic  the World Bank had said that if the virus spread significantly outside the epicentre states of Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia  this could potentially cost Africa tens of billions of dollars in disrupted cross-border trade  supply chains and tourism.  The bank said a scaled-up global response was needed to prevent this worst case scenario. Since then  the United Nations has led international efforts to send more medical personnel to the Ebola zone and increase funding to fight the worst recorded outbreak of the deadly haemorrhagic virus.  The latest WHO Ebola tally on November 14 reported 5 177 deaths out of 14 133 cases  mostly in the three worst-hit countries.  Ferreira also highlighted a more than 30% drop in global oil prices since June as a major concern for the fiscal stability in African oil producers  particularly the continent's largest crude exporter  Nigeria.   ,ebola-96401427dd85f1587cd9380ca162ad6e824c88ca5640c34e6acf58b64b478069,0,2003,2,2016-04-15 14:42:12.756586,

According to Francisco Ferreira  the World Bank's Chief Economist for the Africa Region "The cost of the Ebola epidemic for Sub-Saharan Africa's economy is likely to be closer to $3-4 billion and not the worst-case scenario of $32 billion " reports News Daily.  "The risk of the highest case of economic impact of Ebola has been reduced because of the success of containment in some countries " Ferreira said.  An international effort led by the United Nations has increased medical personnel to the most needed areas.  The World Bank Group has attained roughly $1 billion in financing for the countries hardest hit by the epidemic. The U.S.  England  Germany  Australia and Japan have contributed the most  according to The Telegraph.  However  "Relief efforts must focus not only on those directly affected by the virus  but also on those in the poorest communities for whom market access  mobility  and food security continue to get worse " said Ana Revenga  Senior Director of the Poverty Global Practice at the World Bank.  In addition to the 5 177 deaths tallied by the World Health organization  African jobs and tourism have also been affected.  Based on phone surveys  nearly half of those working in Liberia when the outbreak began in March are no longer working  according to the World Bank.  "The Ebola crisis has already ravaged tourism in Africa because the fear factor kept visitors away from countries even where there had been no cases of the virus  like Kenya and South Africa " according to Ferreira.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,133,Worldwide ebola impact,10016,orld Bank: Ebola's Economic Impact Expected to be High  The World Bank says the three countries most affected by Ebola will suffer a combined $1.6 billion in economic losses in 2015 due to the ongoing outbreak. Unemployment rates are also expected to remain high  with cross-border traders  private-sector wage earners and the self-employed among the worst hit.  The World Bank said that despite the recent slowdown in the number of new Ebola cases  the outbreak continued to "cripple" the economies of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone.  More than half-a-billion dollars was lost due to forgone income in the three countries in 2014. It said that number was expected to more than triple in 2015.  The World Bank said that Sierra Leone would be the worst hit  with $920 million in losses this year  followed by $540 million in Guinea and $180 million for Liberia.  David Evans is a World Bank senior economist for the Africa region.  "The economic impact on these three countries has been nothing short of catastrophic really. Liberia's growth forecast for 2015 has been cut in half and projected growth in Sierra Leone and Guinea for 2015 has shrunk to below zero. These are both countries that had healthy growth rates predicted for 2015 before the epidemic… So this is just a massive  massive negative economic impact " he said.  Evans said that reductions in business activity  trade and planned foreign investment all contributed to these predicted lowered growth rates.  Emily Kolu sells beverages in Monrovia. She said her income was now less than half what it used to be.  "All day long we sit here… Ebola is making my customers afraid because they fear the situation they are in if they come out here… I used to sell sometimes over 20 or 25 crates of beer  but now I am suffering. Now it’s [down to] five or six " she said.  John Kokolu  a local farmer  said he struggled to get his goods to market.  "It's not difficult to grow food  but to take the food to the market is where we are facing problems  because  as I said  there are no public gatherings " he said.  Kokolu said closed borders have also made it impossible to sell his crops outside Liberia.  Exports have also been affected in Guinea. The World Bank  for example  said fish exports to neighboring countries have fallen by 40 percent.  Across the rest of sub-Saharan Africa  economic losses are expected to total around $550 million if the current spread of the disease remains limited.  The World Bank’s Evans said the key now was to finally stop the outbreak.  "The number one thing  ultimately  is getting to zero cases… Until we get to zero cases in these countries  people aren't going to feel completely confident going about their business and moving around and doing what they need to do to provide for their livelihoods " he said.  He said it was difficult to say exactly how long a full recovery will take  but that these economies could bounce back "relatively swiftly" once the outbreak was truly under control.  VOA News / Jan. 29  2015 08:18 KST,ebola-af1930e8f473ce752c3e24bc5bf131bfff10ca46142eab1ddb99e16e7a9099fc,1,3033,2,2016-05-10 15:49:03.624878,

The total cost is now estimated to hit $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors  according to a World Bank report issued Wednesday.Liberia has suffered most in the epidemic  which has killed more than 3 800 people and delivered an economic shock to some of Africa's most vulnerable economies.Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to between 550 000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no additional interventions  a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report warned.Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three countries facing the biggest health crisis -- are also facing huge bills to try and contain the virus.The three countries' economies had been growing. Sierra Leone  in particular  had been identified as a country with the potential for significant growth. Before the outbreak  the IMF had forecast the country to grow by over 14% in 2014. Liberia's economy had been growing by around 10% since 2005  while Guinea had been praised by the IMF for its economic and political reforms.Now  the World Bank estimates the outbreak will cost Sierra Leone $163 million  or 3.3% of its GDP this year. If the epidemic continues to spread  the World Bank estimates it could lose as much as 8.9% of its GDP in 2015. For Liberia  the worst case estimates of cost are $234 million  or 12% of GDP. In Guinea it's $142 million  or 2.3% of GDP.Inflation has also spiked in the region  fueled by uncertainty and capital flight  while exchange rates have been volatile.Big industries sufferAgriculture contributes 57% of Sierra Leone's GDP  39% of Liberia's and 20% of Guinea's. That slice of the economy is in trouble as the rice and maize harvests  which take place between October and December  loom. Fear of the disease  the introduction of curfews and the difficulties of transporting food are expected to have a significant impact on production  according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.West Africa is also rich in iron and gold  and Western mining companies have a strong presence in the region. But Liberia  where more than 2 000 people have died from the Ebola virus  has closed all but major border crossings and introduced a temporary curfew in its attempts to contain the outbreak.The mining industry contributes around 14% of Liberia's economy  with international companies such as ArcelorMittal  Hummingbird  Chevron and Exxon & Total operating many of the mines.Many have imposed travel restrictions on workers and are evacuating non-essential staff from the region. If this continues  "there will be a sizable decline in production " the World Bank said.Scare factorBut it is fear that could prove the most damaging for the countries' economies. According to Jim Yong Kim  World Bank president  the "tide of fear" triggered by the outbreak could cause 80% to 90% of the economic impact. This was the case for both the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks  and it is proving true for Ebola too."The fear factor from the Ebola outbreak has reduced labor force participation  closed places of employment  disrupted transportation  and motivated some government and private decision makers to close seaports and airports " Kim said at a press conference last week.Nearly 800 people died during the 2002 -- 2004 SARS outbreak  which the World Bank estimated cost more than $40 billion in economic losses. The slowdown was mainly caused by the flight of foreign investment and a travel to affected areas falling by up to 70%.Ebola has killed more than three times as many people so far.Stark warningThe number of Ebola cases in the region could rise to between 550 000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no "additional interventions or changes in community behavior " the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.The World Bank estimates more than $1 billion is needed to contain the outbreak and avoid long-term economic disaster. © 2015 HartfordBusiness.com,ebola-876dd719e752459aeb1b29083aad068666c6fe94c677b041ed437a38c4e5a784,0,4405,2,2016-05-10 15:49:24.415958,

One theory states that the media and certain government sponsored agencies such as the CDC  NIH [5] and the FDA are hyping the Ebola crisis to promote the roll-out of mandatory vaccines [6]. This notion promotes the belief that Ebola will not impact that many people but the fear being promoted will drive people to help people like Bill Gates make a fortune [5] from the inevitable vaccines [7] that  will follow this crisis. The theory certainly has merit.  ebola burying dead bodies [,ebola-ecd0c48877425ae0f98ed726ad3eafa6083be76dbdeab3be68cd1a64b3af4db0,0,535,2,2016-04-15 14:14:12.585845, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,134,Government impacts  spending on ebola,1613,The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa has taken a horrible human toll. Although the outbreak originated in rural Guinea  it has hit hardest in Liberia and Sierra Leone  in part because it has reached urban areas in these two countries  a factor that distinguishes this outbreak from previous episodes elsewhere. As of September 10  2014  there had been 2 281 recorded deaths out of 4 614 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola. Experts fear that the true numbers may be two to four times larger  due to underreporting. Misery and suffering have been intense  especially in Liberia where doctors have had to turning patients away for lack of space in Ebola treatment centers. Inevitably  before the outbreak is contained the human impacts will increase considerably over these numbers. Epidemiological estimates are acknowledged as highly uncertain and are not the subject of this note. What is certain is that limiting the human cost will require significant financial resources and a concerted partnership between international partners and the affected countries. Particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone  government capacity is already overrun and the epidemic is impacting macroeconomic activity and budgetary resources. This note informs the response to the epidemic by estimating these macroeconomic and fiscal effects. Any such exercise is necessarily highly imprecise due to limited data and many uncertain factors  but it is still necessary in order to plan the economic assistance that must accompany the immediate humanitarian response. The goal is to help affected countries to recover and return to the robust economic growth they had experienced until the offset of this crisis. en_US dc.language	 English,ebola-849d25a28372bdaf22273a797812aed3a5711006ab39c729fb5ea63d54bdf4c9,0,1740,2,2016-04-15 14:24:12.423128,

The report describes a four per cent fall over 2014 in the 11.3 per cent growth rate projected for Sierra Leone before the crisis. Guinea and Liberia are also expected to see large reductions  with the total fiscal impact for the three countries in 2014 topping $500 million  about five per cent of their combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  With investors steering clear  growth estimates for 2015 have also been revised down  the report notes. Guinea and Sierra Leone are expected to see their economies contract – by 0.2 per cent and two percent respectively – while predicted growth for Liberia has been reduced to three percent. Pre-Ebola growth estimates for 2015 in Guinea were 4.3 per cent; in Sierra Leone were 8.9 per cent; and in Liberia were 6.8 per cent.  Expected Forgone GDP in 2015 due to Ebola and Global Economic Conditions (in US dollars)  That implies total forgone income in 2015 of around $1.6 billion  with around $500 million lost by Guinea  $900 million by Sierra Leone and $200 million by Liberia – more than 12 per cent of their combined gross domestic products (GDPs).  Despite its warnings  the new report revises the Bank's previous estimate of the probability of the epidemic's spread and the associated economic costs beyond the three most-affected countries.  Thanks in large part to the intensive global and national responses over the past several months  the projected downside scenario of $25 billion in economic losses for 2015 no longer applies. For sub-Saharan Africa as a whole  the range of downside risk extends from a low of $500 million to a high of $6.2 billion.  Region-wide losses could be closer to the report's higher end estimate of $6 billion if Ebola does spread beyond the three worst affected countries  while the minimum expected loss of $500 million is attributed to eroded consumer and investor confidence since the outbreak  as well as disruption to travel and cross-border trade.  Containment and preparedness efforts have dramatically limited the potential impact  as have public health improvements  such as safer burials  better detection  public awareness campaigns  more health workers and facilities  and better contact tracing. At the same time  neighbouring countries have contributed to reduced risk of spread across borders having adopted fast and effective containment measures.  “This report demonstrates why all countries should make investing in pandemic preparedness a top priority for 2015 ” said Mr. Kim  noting that a major lesson from the outbreak is the need for much quicker global responses to disease outbreaks.  “It points to the need for a global pandemic emergency financing facility that will enable the world to respond much more quickly and effectively to any future deadly outbreaks  and avoid the tragic and unnecessary human and economic costs that have resulted from the Ebola epidemic.”  The Bank Group is mobilizing nearly US$1 billion in financing for the countries hardest hit by the Ebola crisis. This includes US$518 million from IDA for the epidemic response  and at least $450 million from IFC  a member of the World Bank Group  to enable trade  investment  and employment in Guinea  Liberia  and Sierra Leone.  ,ebola-766fefdddad16d870df27d6bca55beb78572c56bcc191292290c7729ac1cc826,7,4058,2,2016-04-15 14:37:47.994666,

The economy has fallen into ârecession because of the deadly Ebola virus disease â Konneh told reporters in the capital  Monrovia. âIt means we have to tighten our belts by reducing expenditure to within our means.â  The International Monetary Fund cut its expansion forecast for Liberiaâs economy to 2.5 percent this year from a previous estimate of 5.9 percent  spokesman Ismaila Dieng said yesterday. The other West African nations at the center of the outbreak also had their outlooks reduced. Sierra Leone was cut to 8 percent from 11.3 percent and Guinea to 2.4 percent from 3.5 percent  said Dieng.  Those countries each need as much as $130 million in fiscal and balance of payment support and the IMF is exploring ways it can help  IMF spokesman William Murray said. Expansion in Liberia  whose economy was gutted during a 1989-2003 civil war  was 8.7 percent last year  said Konneh.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,134,Government impacts  spending on ebola,1655,Last month the World Bank issued a report on the Ebola outbreak's financial repercussions. It noted that  along with the toll in human lives and suffering  the epidemic was creating higher fiscal deficits in the affected countries -- as well as higher prices  lower incomes and an overall increase in poverty levels.  In the short-term  the economic impact for the worst-hit countries has been enormous: With Ebola-related losses costing Liberia an estimated 4.7 percent of its GDP  it is also draining off nearly two percent of gross domestic product from both Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Adding to the tragedy  according to a new report by The Brookings Institution  is that Sierra Leone and Liberia had seen their economies strengthen prior to the outbreak  as the two nations recovered from years of civil war and political upheaval.  The epidemic is also crippling West African economies via a wide spectrum of factors. International travel quarantines  for example  are reducing revenues from trade  transport and tourism. At the same time  the epidemic has halted a large percentage of the region's agricultural activity  which is expected to affect crop yields on several essential food staples  while creating food price spikes.  And fear of disease has eroded investor confidence  which in turn has restricted work  production and output at several international mining and oil operations in the region.  But the economic impact doesn't stop in West Africa. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is projecting that around 1.4 million people will become infected with Ebola before the epidemic runs its course. And the United Nations is estimating the costs of containing the Ebola outbreak at about $1 billion.  "This is not just a health crisis " U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last month. "It has grave humanitarian  economic and social consequences that could spread far beyond the affected countries."  However  as World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim noted in September  "our findings make clear that the sooner we get an adequate containment response and decrease the level of fear and uncertainty  the faster we can blunt Ebola's economic impact."  © 2014 CBS Interactive Inc..

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,134,Government impacts  spending on ebola,1734,Sept. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Liberia has entered a recession and the government needs to curb spending as the worldâs deadliest Ebola outbreak in West Africa has hampered agriculture and business  Finance Minister Amara Konneh said.  The economy has fallen into ârecession because of the deadly Ebola virus disease â Konneh told reporters in the capital  Monrovia  yesterday. âIt means we have to tighten our belts by reducing expenditure to within our means.â  The International Monetary Fund cut its expansion forecast for Liberiaâs economy to 2.5 percent this year from a previous estimate of 5.9 percent  spokesman Ismaila Dieng said yesterday. The other West African nations at the center of the outbreak also had their outlooks reduced. Sierra Leone was cut to 8 percent from 11.3 percent and Guinea to 2.4 percent from 3.5 percent  said Dieng.  Those countries each need as much as $130 million in fiscal and balance of payment support and the IMF is exploring ways it can help  IMF spokesman William Murray said. Expansion in Liberia  whose economy was gutted during a 1989-2003 civil war  was 8.7 percent last year  said Konneh.  Liberia has been the worst hit by the Ebola outbreak  recording 1 224 of the 2 288 deaths since the first case in December  according to the World Health Organization.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,383,Economic impact of ebola,134,Government impacts  spending on ebola,2055,The Ebola epidemic continues to cripple the economies of Liberia  Sierra Leone  and Guinea. The crisis is resulting in flat or negative income growth and creating large fiscal needs in all three countries  as they work to eradicate the virus. This update presents the World Bank s most recent analysis of the economic effects of the Ebola epidemic on the three countries. All three had been growing rapidly in recent years  and into the first half of 2014. But GDP growth estimates for 2014 have been revised sharply downward since pre-crisis estimates. Projected 2014 growth in Liberia is now 2.2 percent (versus 5.9 percent before the crisis and 2.5 percent in October). Projected 2014 growth in Sierra Leone is now 4.0 percent (versus 11.3 percent before the crisis and 8.0 percent in October). Projected 2014 growth in Guinea is now 0.5 percent (versus 4.5 percent before the crisis and 2.4 percent in October). The World Bank s October report on the economic impact of Ebola (report no. 91219 released at the 2014 Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank) found that if the epidemic continues in the three worst-affected countries and spreads to neighboring countries  the two-year regional financial impact could range from a "low Ebola" estimate of $3.8 billion to a "high Ebola" estimate of $32.6 billion. These scale estimates of potential impact remain valid: the epidemic is not yet under control. Containment  combined with a full-fledged financial recovery effort to restart business activity and bring back investors  are now both therefore urgently needed for the region to improve on the downbeat forecasts in this update. ,ebola-67e3640ae2ac5c1d5ca9c40cfd4ddbeecad1ebb32fb884b75ab8465e3d62b9fe,0,1644,2,2016-04-18 10:36:02.347649,

The report comes as World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim begins a two-day visit to West Africa to assess the epidemic’s impact and discuss with governments and international agencies what steps need to be taken to reach the goal of zero cases as soon as possible.  This report updates the World Bank Group’s October 8 analysis of the economic effects of the Ebola crisis on the three hardest-hit countries. GDP growth estimates for 2014 have been revised sharply downward since pre-crisis estimates to 2.2 percent for Liberia (versus 5.9 percent pre-crisis and 2.5 percent in October); and 4.0 percent for Sierra Leone (versus 11.3 percent pre-crisis and 8.0 percent in October); and 0.5 percent for Guinea (versus 4.5 percent pre-crisis and 2.4 percent in October). All three countries had been growing rapidly in recent years and into the first half of 2014.  In addition  the World Bank Group is now projecting negative growth for 2015 of -0.2% in Guinea (down from pre-crisis estimates of 4.3 percent and 2.0 percent in October) and -2.0% in Sierra Leone (down from 8.9 percent and 7.7 percent in October). In Liberia  where there are signs of progress in containing the epidemic and some increasing economic activity  the updated 2015 growth estimate is 3.0 percent  an  increase from 1.0 percent in October but still less than half the pre-crisis estimate of 6.8 percent. These latest projections imply forgone income across the three countries in 2014–15 totaling more than $2 billion.  “This report reinforces why zero Ebola cases must be our goal. While there are signs of progress  as long as the epidemic continues  the human and economic impact will only grow more devastating ” said Jim Yong Kim  President of the World Bank Group. “As we accelerate the immediate health response  the international community must also do everything we can to help the affected countries back on the road to economic recovery and development.”    The report finds that the total fiscal impact is more than half a billion dollars in 2014 alone  imposing additional budget needs of more than 6.0 percent of GDP in Liberia  more than 3.0 percent in Guinea  and more than 2.5 percent in Sierra Leone. Governments have also been forced to cut public investments – such as Liberia’s Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant  which now remains on hold in the absence of foreign contractors – by more than $160 million across the three countries  hurting future growth prospects.  ,ebola-0853672e04411d5945d0b84d9f91be349eb94a75ecd445fd24826938cd4dd0f2,0,2799,2,2016-04-18 10:36:27.933986,

Konneh has concluded discussions with officials of the World Bank  IMF and other development partners aimed at mobilizing support for the government's fight against the Ebola epidemic. In conversation with the World Bank  Konneh requested that the World Bank and other development partners use their convening power to assist Liberia raise additional resources to fight Ebola and also support the country's economic recovery plan. For more than a week  Minister Konneh and delegation  including Central Bank Governor Dr. Mills Jones  the President of the Liberia Bank for Investment and Development  John Davies  Representative Munah Pelham-Youngblood amongst others have been in Washington DC working to make Liberia's case. The delegation articulated clearly Liberia was looking for new avenues of support to fight Ebola and deal with probable associated economic and social issues. The Liberian Team requested that bilateral and multilateral partners to not re-program existing commitments but rather provide injection of new funds. Minister Konneh said the discussions were fruitful and Liberia was able to make a strong case for the World Bank to provide additional assistance following the provision of US$52 million of crisis funds last month. âWe aiming to raise around $50 million dollars as direct support and we hope our key projects will be accelerated  including work on the Redlight to Gbarnga road  and feasibility studies on the Ganta to Tappita road " Konneh said. Minister Konneh also met with the head of USAID Raj Shah  who assured him that every support will be provided to help stop the transmission of Ebola. Discussions were also held with the Millennium Challenge Corporation over a possible funding window that could be harnessed to accelerate Liberia's economic stabilization and recovery. Discussions were also held with the IMF over additional support beyond the recent $48 million dollars under the Extended Credit Facility program to be channeled through the Central Bank of Liberia. Efforts were also made for additional commitments under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF. The Head of the (IMF) Madam Christine Lagarde suggested to her colleagues that there is a need for more budgetary support for Liberia as short-term spending is critical during these difficult eras. In the US  Minister Amara Konneh consummated a deal worth US$27 million dollars with the European Investment Bank (EIB) for the rehabilitation of the Roberts International Airport Runway. EIB also expressed willingness to work together on future pipeline projects. In meeting with the Swedish International Development Office  Minister Konneh pleaded with the Sweds to increase their support to Liberia  in addition to the US $10 million dollar committed through International Non-Governmental Organizations. In a related development  the International Finance Corporation has agreed to provide an immediate injection of roughly $15 million dollars to the banking sector for trade financing. The IFC is also actively exploring ways to provide financing to small businesses  particularly in the Agriculture sector.  ,ebola-e0cd585d688dca3e287f81d2cc741807121de5583f3b0d0787dc279a67939b09,0,3179,2,2016-04-18 10:39:48.675316,

Gallup has measured public perceptions of the leading U.S. health problem annually since 1999. This year's results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey  conducted in early November. At the time of the new survey  only one of the four people who had been diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was still being treated  and the other two surviving patients had already been declared virus-free. Gallup researchers said that it is a testament to the gravity of the Ebola virus that it still sparks relatively high public concern several weeks after the peak of the U.S. scare.

The roles and responsibilities of doctors and nurses are changing faster than the training can change  and it will inevitably have a trickling down effect into the way nurses especially are trained early on. According to U.S. Bureau of Statistics  after completing a Registered Nurse (RN) program  over 58 000 new and replacement RN jobs will be needed by just 2018. However  with this recent Ebola outbreak and worldwide scare especially among the healthcare industry  that number could go up significantly. And what about impact on insurers and insurance costs? CBS news explored this question and conducted an estimate of the costs involved in the treatment of Thomas Duncan (who was uninsured). Their estimate equated to $1 000 an hour  or about $500 000 overall. And that is for just one patient. Since those in Africa have no health insurance like we do here in the U.S.  the global impact on insurance has not been felt  but if an outbreak occurs in the U.S.  “the industry would have to grapple with other insurance-related considerations  including issues such as workers compensation  general liability and medical malpractice.” It appears time will only tell as we all hold our breaths and wish for the best for those affected. More about	Ebola virus  healthcare workers  Healthcare industry More news from	 	 Comments (1) ,ebola-d509bdb0afc26eed8ed04f6530217a8510eea3aaa2c3cd04cd2cc14fa8ecc7e8,0,1522,2,2016-04-20 14:08:06.487611,

1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,178,healthcare costs of ebola,3719,As hospitals scramble to properly prepare for any further outbreaks of the Ebola virus in the United States  they are bumping up against the inevitable barrier: cost. Hospitals are finding that merely preparing for the narrow possibility of treating an Ebola patient can cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The costs can come on quickly  even if a hospital may be treating a patient who is only suspected of having Ebola. That was case at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Its costs included $100 000 for personal protective equipment  $8 000 to $10 000 for heavy plastic sheeting  payments for specialized medical waste removal  and overtime for the nursing staff and other hospital employees.  "There were major categories of costs and expenses above and beyond what we'd necessarily have for any other patient " Chris Ruder  vice president of patient care services at the hospital  told the Kansas City Star. "For example  everything the physicians and nurses wore when they went into the patient's room was completely disposable. And we had six nurses at any one time taking care of that one patient--a twelvefold increase in nursing care instead of the usual one nurse taking care of two patients in the ICU--plus physicians and a dedicated infectious disease team. The ratio of human resource to one patient was exorbitantly higher."  At hospitals in the Lower Hudson Valley region in New York  the cost of preparing for a potential Ebola patient could be $500 000 or more  the Poughkeepsie Journal reported. Nyack Hospital put the price tag of preparation at between $250 000 and $500 000. The cost at Westchester Medical Center is up to $700 000 for the creation of a containment area to safely treat an Ebola patient.  Those hospitals are likely moving to a higher state of alert after reports of a Manhattan emergency room physician who was diagnosed with Ebola after treating infected patients in western Africa. At the same time  hospitals that do not properly prepare for Ebola cases are at risk for taking a financial hit if they must treat a patient and it is not handled well.  To learn more: - ,ebola-656efed7fd698911699487b736ca92c6995682b5534de107951de63e4fba69b4,0,2127,2,2016-04-20 16:29:34.449609,

Duncan died last week after 11 days of treatment.

Getting a clean bill of health took 13 days in the hospital and an estimated $110 000.  Daily hospital care for Ebola can easily reach $8 500 per day  according to Lockton  a global insurance company in Kansas City  Mo.â$6 000 a day in an intensive care unit  plus $2 500 per day for additional costs  such as physician fees and aggressive support therapy. Costs may even be higher than that  says Eric Justin  Locktonâs chief medical officer  if there are other health complications. That was the case with the U.S.âs first Ebola patient  Thomas Eric Duncan  who was also on dialysis.  Based on a two-week confinement  Lockton estimates that the minimum expense for an intensive care unit alone at any hospital would reach $100 000. Experimental medication expenses or care in a specialized biocontainment facility could easily push costs to $500 000 or more. That doesnât account for potential complications like loss of hearing or vision  bringing disability or long-term health care costs into play.  So who would pay? For now  standard health insurance policies would respond  although itâs unclear exactly how much care they may pay for  says Logan Payne of Locktonâs international practice. Most health-care policies  for example  wouldnât cover experimental treatments  but Justin says patients canât be charged for such drugs as ZMapp  which has been given to several Ebola victims  until after the FDA approves them. Thus  âfor an indeterminate period of time when those experimental drugs are used â there likely wonât be a cost for the medication  he adds.  Depending on how a person contracted the virus  Payne says workers compensation could cover medical costs. Insurance carriers would have to determine if the exposure to the virus happened while the individual was in the scope of her work. Health-care workers  therefore  would most likely be covered. Aid worker and nurse Nancy Writebol  who got Ebola while she was working in Liberia as part of missionary group SIM  is covered by SIMâs health and workersâ comp plans; SIM plans to pay her $25 000 deductible  according to a SIM executive. NBC and Vice Media are helping pay freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpoâs medical bills because he contracted Ebola in Liberia while working for the media outlets.  Some insurance companies have already addressed Ebola insurance concerns in recent days. On Allianz Worldwide Careâs (ALV:GR) website  the insurer released a fact sheet that says  âPlease note that all Allianz Worldwide Care policyholders are fully covered for all investigations into  and treatment of  Ebola infection.â And on Cignaâs (CI) website  the company states  âStandard evacuation benefits and procedures (as stated in your plan documents) apply to requests for evacuations of Ebola patients.â  ,ebola-c5289bf213a627c2e398e65ea503f3414e264a01d3b73ee01486f0ffafc4542a,0,3054,2,2016-04-23 14:48:54.574412, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,178,healthcare costs of ebola,4975,The arrival of Ebola in the United States this year led to an unprecedented medical response involving experimental drugs  round-the-clock care  and layers upon layers of protective gear. And none of it has been cheap.  Nine people have been treated for the virus in the U.S. since August. Seven recovered. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center  which treated one of them  estimates treatment for patients diagnosed with Ebola costs $50 000 a day. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center  which cared for two patients  put the daily cost at $30 000  and the total at $1.16 million for a single patient. Most patients have been hospitalized for more than two weeks.  The U.S. has shown it can beat Ebola. But who will pay for the expensive care it takes to do it?  It's a tough question  and one that the people holding the bills seem reluctant to answer. Hospitals that have treated patients in Georgia  Nebraska  New York  and Texas did not respond to requests for comment  nor did the governors' offices of these states. NIH was forthcoming about cost of care  but the feds pick up the tab for treatment there.  The topic of payment came up during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month but only briefly. The Obama administration had requested $6.18 billion in emergency funding for Ebola response efforts in the U.S. Missing from the request  said Sen. Mike Johanns  was funding that would cover treatment of patients with Ebola on American soil. The federal government should cover the University of Nebraska Medical Center's costs  he said  because it had asked the medical facility to take in patients.  "We were glad to do it " said the Republican lawmaker from Nebraska. "But it seems at this point some assistance in terms of reimbursement would be appropriate  because treating an Ebola patient is worlds different than treating Mike Johanns who walks in with a severe case of the flu."  Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that conversations about payment have so far remained between hospitals and private insurers. "To date  it has not been an issue that has come to us " she said. "If this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding  we're happy to entertain that."  Sen. Barbara Mikulski  D-Md.  the Senate Appropriations Committee chair  agreed with Johanns about exploring federal reimbursement options. "It is costly " she said at the hearing  referring to Ebola treatments. But neither the committee nor the panelists had a real solution. "Let's talk about this. Let's keep working on it."  Some hospitals  faced with these costs  are tentatively looking to the feds to foot the bill. New York City health officials said earlier this month that Bellevue Hospital's treatment of one patient with Ebola was expected to be so expensive that they would seek federal funding to help pay the bills. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  which treated four patients  has asked Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement for Ebola cases. One case  they said  can cost up to $1 million.  "Caring for patients with Ebola virus disease effectively and safely is enormously resource-consuming  far above and beyond usual care " the hospital wrote in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Nov. 7. Emory officials said payment should be a collaborative effort  using both federal and private sources.  At the time of this writing  there are no reported cases of Ebola in the U.S. But federal health officials have said that as long as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa—which has infected more than 15 300 people and killed 5 459 of them—rages on  there could be more patients. And those patients most likely won't be able to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills on their own.  More from,ebola-a1bbdcaf118f90905055696994e41a17fcb3203873c1cd4b284308bde66fdd98,0,3835,0,2016-04-23 14:50:28.501259, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,178,healthcare costs of ebola,4977,Ebola preparation is costly for hospitals  October 26  2014 | By Ron Shinkman As hospitals scramble to properly prepare for any further outbreaks of the Ebola virus in the United States  they are bumping up against the inevitable barrier: cost. Hospitals are finding that merely preparing for the narrow possibility of treating an Ebola patient can cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The costs can come on quickly  even if a hospital may be treating a patient who is only suspected of having Ebola. That was case at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Its costs included $100 000 for personal protective equipment  $8 000 to $10 000 for heavy plastic sheeting  payments for specialized medical waste removal  and overtime for the nursing staff and other hospital employees.  "There were major categories of costs and expenses above and beyond what we'd necessarily have for any other patient " Chris Ruder  vice president of patient care services at the hospital  told the Kansas City Star. "For example  everything the physicians and nurses wore when they went into the patient's room was completely disposable. And we had six nurses at any one time taking care of that one patient--a twelvefold increase in nursing care instead of the usual one nurse taking care of two patients in the ICU--plus physicians and a dedicated infectious disease team. The ratio of human resource to one patient was exorbitantly higher."  At hospitals in the Lower Hudson Valley region in New York  the cost of preparing for a potential Ebola patient could be $500 000 or more  the Poughkeepsie Journal reported. Nyack Hospital put the price tag of preparation at between $250 000 and $500 000. The cost at Westchester Medical Center is up to $700 000 for the creation of a containment area to safely treat an Ebola patient.  Those hospitals are likely moving to a higher state of alert after reports of a Manhattan emergency room physician who was diagnosed with Ebola after treating infected patients in western Africa. At the same time  hospitals that do not properly prepare for Ebola cases are at risk for taking a financial hit if they must treat a patient and it is not handled well.  To learn more: - ,ebola-735bf13d0de22aba9ca5e1408e55786b08c4e7d8bc6e55e74f8c66b6a14ea657,0,2205,2,2016-04-23 14:52:56.619761, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,178,healthcare costs of ebola,4978,Start with a $100 000 order for more personal protective equipment than usual and the price quickly mounted when the University of Kansas Hospital last week cared for a possible Ebola patient.  Add about $8 000 to $10 000 worth of heavy plastic sheeting and materials used to seal off the isolation area from the rest of the hospital.  Count in nursing overtime. Tally extra costs for hazardous waste removal. Figure in communication costs to handle the media. And note that an entire seven-bed intensive care unit â which usually would have been filled with other patients â was devoted to the care of just one person.  âThere were major categories of costs and expenses above and beyond what weâd necessarily have for any other patient â said Chris Ruder  vice president of patient care services at the hospital.  The Kansas City  Kan.  Ebola scare  which turned out to be more of an infectious disease practice event  gave the hospital a clear window into the cost of best-practice care for the infectious and often fatal disease. By using equipment and procedures that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since said are the right things to do  KU Hospital had an expensive 48-hour experience.  The full bill isnât known  but a recap of those stressful days hints at what any medical center might face if a possible Ebola sufferer comes to its doors.  âFor example  everything the physicians and nurses wore when they went into the patientâs room was completely disposable â Ruder said. âAnd we had six nurses at any one time taking care of that one patient â a twelvefold increase in nursing care instead of the usual one nurse taking care of two patients in the ICU â plus physicians and a dedicated infectious disease team. The ratio of human resource to one patient was exorbitantly higher.â  The expensive  airtight protective suits  hoods  gloves and respirators could only be worn for two to four hours at a stretch before the workers became drenched in sweat. The hospital even bought underwear  socks and booties in all sizes for the workers to wear because they also had to be disposed of after each two- to four-hour service time.  Separately  the International Association of Fire Fighters calculated an average cost of $382.31 for one set of personal protective equipment that would be considered adequate for a first responder to handle a possible Ebola victim.  The association points out that the protective suitâs cost doesnât begin to consider extra costs for throwing away a gurney mattress  blankets or anything else that may carry the virus after a sufferer is transported in an ambulance. Nor does it figure the expense of disinfecting care providers  equipment or vehicles.  Ruder noted that major hospitals  already prepared to handle infectious disease  have many materials and facilities  such as negative-airflow rooms  already on hand. But the emergency construction of separate caregiving zones outside the patientâs isolation room required a temporary sealed tunnel of plastic sheeting and creation of anterooms for workers to put on and take off protective gear and move to the shower.  âWeâve even replaced the ceiling tiles in our negative-airflow rooms with nonporous tiles â Ruder said.  ,ebola-d900eef0e972737c731a1f72ab6d975c532667543afd66c9f65f01be65d6fcea,0,3279,2,2016-04-23 15:13:55.208380, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,178,healthcare costs of ebola,5109,That's the model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October.  The Kansas City  Kansas  hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient's room and a decontamination area.  The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses  who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination.  It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn't have Ebola  but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp up in the future.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,178,healthcare costs of ebola,5114,CONNECT 5 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Strong Memorial Hospital spent about $700 000 on renovations and equipment in case it had a patient with Ebola  and it continues to spend $50 000 a month on training to keep a select group of more than 100 staffers ready.  "We anticipated there would be expense " executive vice president and chief operating officer Kathy Parrinello said. "We did not anticipate the degree to which we needed to invest in this."  Parrinello said Thursday the hospital spent the money without a specific promise that it would be made whole by the state or federal government.  "We assumed we'd be able to work something out with expenses " Parrinello said  basing the belief on other experiences. "But nothing definitive was worked out in advance."  Now Strong is among several hospitals in New York and around the country waiting to see how the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services apportions $700 million to pay them back.  A decision on how to distribute that money  part of the fiscal year 2015 omnibus budget bill that includes money for Ebola response  is expected in the next couple of weeks.  On Thursday  Sen. Charles Schumer  D-N.Y.  held a conference call with reporters in which he called on HHS to reimburse New York's five Ebola treatment centers as well as community hospitals that had to comply with state preparedness regulations.  Schumer said that the five treatment centers â Strong  Erie County Medical Center  Women and Children's Hospital in Buffalo  Westchester Medical Center and Upstate University Hospital â spent about $4 million. He said the remainder of the state's hospitals spent an average of $40 000.  "If you are a smaller hospital in one of our not-so-large cities in upstate New York  that's a lot of money " he told reporters. "We have 87 hospitals north of New York City and for many of them  $40 000 is a lot of money  especially if it wasn't budgeted for.''  Four medical centers in New York City and the North Shore System Long Island Jewish/Glen Cove Hospital on Long Island are part of the federally designated system. Only one â Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan â has treated an Ebola patient.  Schumer said that shouldn't matter. "... The costs of being prepared have been extremely high in order to be ready for a potential patient."  Strong Memorial Hospital  while part of the University of Rochester  is self-supporting and the money spent on Ebola preparedness came from its budget. Parrinello said that $700 000 is a significant amount  and it could put a damper on future projects.  Parrinello said Strong began its preparations in October  when it agreed to be designated by the New York state Department of Health as a treatment center.  "We went into this because there was need in the community and we're the institution that is looked to to be prepared for these things " Parrinello said  citing the regional reach of its specialty services such as the Kessler Burn and Trauma Center and Golisano Children's Hospital. "We understand that's part of our role."  Strong has not had a suspected or confirmed case of Ebola.  The Monroe County Department of Public Health had monitored people who traveled to West African nations  which has been coping with a monthslong epidemic. A Webster nurse who treated patients in Liberia in November and returned home last month was monitored for 21 days by the state health department. She showed no symptoms of the disease.  "While the Ebola headlines have largely faded  the costs of Ebola preparedness have not " Kenneth Raske  president of the Greater New York Hospital Association  said in a statement. "Any one of New York's Ebola treatment centers may be called into action in a moment's notice  and they continue to incur enormous ongoing Ebola training  plant  and equipment expenses.''  Parrinello said an isolation unit with an anteroom and a separate lab area were among the renovations. She said the hospital bought personal protective equipment and trained staff in putting on the gear and taking it off to avoid contamination.  While there doesn't seem to be an obvious immediate return  the investment is paying off. Parrinello said the isolation unit can be used for other patients until it's needed to keep a person sequestered. She said the equipment is not used in everyday care  but it could be used in another type of emergency.  Parrinello expressed appreciation that Schumer was championing the cause at the same time saying the hospital will absorb the expense.  "It would be very appropriate to get reimbursed. But it is a responsibility we assume."  PSINGER@DemocratandChronicle.com  ,ebola-867253bdb1c189d62fa636f0d6ee3b666a1d7fc78cd047927ea05becfbfc00e2,0,4649,2,2016-04-25 10:50:31.743998,

Of that  $1.2 billion will go overseas to help combat the epidemic in West Africa  with support for programs such as labs  infection control and waste management.  The rest of the C.D.C. money will be used for domestic initiatives  such as preparing states to respond to an Ebola case  paying for quarantines that were put in place and worker training.

At the same time  hospitals that do not properly prepare for Ebola cases are at risk for taking a financial hit if they must treat a patient and it is not handled well.  To learn more: - ,ebola-735bf13d0de22aba9ca5e1408e55786b08c4e7d8bc6e55e74f8c66b6a14ea657,0,2205,2,2016-04-23 14:52:48.865949, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,193,Who pays for healthcare,5133,An ambulance transports Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse Nina Pham on Oct. 16 in Frederick  Md.  Nina Pham  a Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola while caring for the first person in the U.S. to have the virus  is now Ebola-free. Getting a clean bill of health took 13 days in the hospital and an estimated $110 000.  Daily hospital care for Ebola can easily reach $8 500 per day  according to Lockton  a global insurance company in Kansas City  Mo.â$6 000 a day in an intensive care unit  plus $2 500 per day for additional costs  such as physician fees and aggressive support therapy. Costs may even be higher than that  says Eric Justin  Locktonâs chief medical officer  if there are other health complications. That was the case with the U.S.âs first Ebola patient  Thomas Eric Duncan  who was also on dialysis.  Based on a two-week confinement  Lockton estimates that the minimum expense for an intensive care unit alone at any hospital would reach $100 000. Experimental medication expenses or care in a specialized biocontainment facility could easily push costs to $500 000 or more. That doesnât account for potential complications like loss of hearing or vision  bringing disability or long-term health care costs into play.  So who would pay? For now  standard health insurance policies would respond  although itâs unclear exactly how much care they may pay for  says Logan Payne of Locktonâs international practice. Most health-care policies  for example  wouldnât cover experimental treatments  but Justin says patients canât be charged for such drugs as ZMapp  which has been given to several Ebola victims  until after the FDA approves them. Thus  âfor an indeterminate period of time when those experimental drugs are used â there likely wonât be a cost for the medication  he adds.  Depending on how a person contracted the virus  Payne says workers compensation could cover medical costs. Insurance carriers would have to determine if the exposure to the virus happened while the individual was in the scope of her work. Health-care workers  therefore  would most likely be covered. Aid worker and nurse Nancy Writebol  who got Ebola while she was working in Liberia as part of missionary group SIM  is covered by SIMâs health and workersâ comp plans; SIM plans to pay her $25 000 deductible  according to a SIM executive. NBC and Vice Media are helping pay freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpoâs medical bills because he contracted Ebola in Liberia while working for the media outlets.  Some insurance companies have already addressed Ebola insurance concerns in recent days. On Allianz Worldwide Careâs (ALV:GR) website  the insurer released a fact sheet that says  âPlease note that all Allianz Worldwide Care policyholders are fully covered for all investigations into  and treatment of  Ebola infection.â And on Cignaâs (CI) website  ,ebola-3e93941e57cf11901d833b4dbd3f716d5670c0ae893ff3214f3398575cdbf1a0,0,2895,2,2016-04-25 10:58:26.543472,

1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,194,healthcare insurance,4971,Effect on the Life and Health Insurance Industries  The effects on the Life and Health insurance industries will clearly depend on whether the infected people are insured. Some of those who have died up to now were children and almost certainly did not have life insurance. Even if the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens or even hundreds of thousands of adults in Africa  it is not likely to trigger many life insurance or health insurance claims there. Life insurance coverage in the three most affected countriesâGuinea  Liberia and Sierra Leoneâis extremely low. Indeed  in Swiss Reâs most recent report on life premiums per capita (for 2013)  the calculation for all three of these countries is so small that none makes the list. Even in the unlikely event that the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens of thousands of adults in the United States  the financial impact will likely be quite manageable. This is because perhaps one-third of adults in the U.S. have life insurance only through their employment  and the amount is typically equal to one yearâs income. Another one-third have individual life insurance  with the average death benefit in the $200 000 range. In a typical year life insurers pay about 2 million death claims  so another 100 000 would be only 5 percent more than typical. Moreover  most life insurers are well capitalized  and even the largest life insurers have reinsurance to prevent a surge in death claims from imperiling their solvency  so that the net effect would likely be  at most  a reduction in the profit they would otherwise record. The cost of caring for Ebola cases would likely be at the high end of health insurance claims  and the effect on health insurers would depend on the number of people suspected of being infected. Many people would need to be tested to see whether they have contracted the virus  and the cost of isolation of those affected could be substantial. Note that some individuals may have no health insurance  as was the case with the index (first) patient who died of Ebola at a Dallas hospital on October 8. In such cases  treatment costs will likely be borne outside the private health insurance system. ,ebola-34a6569ccbbe792ffee42bab987f51075e40528ae0f7dbb27dc3f91c89d00885,0,2179,2,2016-04-22 16:51:40.146156,

Fielded October 8-14  during which time a nurse in Dallas became the second patient diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.1  the survey finds that Ebola tops the list of news stories followed by the public this month  with U.S. airstrikes against Islamic militants the only other story garnering similar levels of attention. While the vast majority of the public knows the basics of how the virus is transmitted – Â through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick with Ebola – fewer are aware that a person with Ebola must be showing symptoms in order to be contagious. Nearly two-thirds say they are at least somewhat worried the U.S. will see a large number of Ebola cases  and about four in ten are worried that they or a family member will contract the disease. Still  a majority believes the most likely scenario is that Ebola will be contained to a small number of cases in the U.S.  and most trust their local  state  and federal health authorities to prevent Ebolaâs spread. Most Americans â including majorities of Republicans  Democrats  and Independents â think the U.S. should play a major role in addressing the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Majorities support the U.S. providing financial aid  medical supplies and personnel  and fewer but still a majority support sending troops and military personnel to fight Ebola in Africa  with the publicâs top two reasons for providing such support being to protect the health of Americans and to save lives in the African countries affected. The public is divided about whether the U.S. government is doing enough to fight Ebola abroad and at home.  Attention To News  News coverage of Ebola in Africa and the U.S. topped the list of closely-followed news stories this month. Seven in ten (69 percent) say they followed news about the diagnosis of the first Ebola case in the U.S. âveryâ or âfairlyâ closely  and nearly as many report closely following the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (63 percent  similar to 62 percent last month). Close attention is somewhat heightened on the home front  with a larger share saying they followed the first U.S. Ebola case âveryâ closely (32 percent) compared with the outbreak in West Africa (24 percent).  ,ebola-22a9ce04dfcb83b81460d5f20e066374bb0435d03c8bdc2849b0b5c9d67ddc06,0,2672,2,2016-04-22 16:52:23.485931, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,196,provider impacts,3584,By Alyssa Sellors     Oct 20  2014 in Health For most in the healthcare industry  the Ebola outbreak is a complete game changer  and something very few are prepared to deal with. But what does this mean for the healthcare industry as a whole? This past week  news broke that two nurses treating the first person ever diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. (though contracted in West Africa) became the first two people ever infected organically here in the U.S. Blame unrightfully first came down on the nurses themselves  Nina Pham and Amber Vinson; however  as the story broke  the truth came out and it pointed entirely to improper protocol. Following chain of command from the nurse to the hospital  the true blame though lies with the CDC and their inability to keep up with this U.S. spread of Ebola. The healthcare workers are only doing what they know here in the U.S.  and having never been exposed with such a unique and infectious disease  there is real fear among these healthcare workers. According to an article in Forbes this week  “a disproportionate number of people of people sickened with Ebola in West Africa are health care workers ” and Doctors without Borders reports that 16 of its staff has contracted Ebola in this current outbreak alone  with nine already dead. Looking at the numbers  around the world about 400 healthcare staff has contracted Ebola with more than 230 dead. Although these are workers in the thick of the epidemic  it’s not a good sign when the only Ebola patient admitted to a “regular” hospital dies and then ends with infected healthcare workers. Ensuring the protection of healthcare workers is a time consuming and costly undertaking that many are not prepared for  especially in countries like Africa where the disease is spreading like a rampant running wildfire. Though a complicated process  it is an essential one to avoid further errors in here in the U.S. like what happened in Dallas. The CDC is still working on a revision of current safety protocols for dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola  and until then  only a few select hospitals like Emory in Atlanta  Georgia  are handling the few cases. But what should we do about the other hospitals in the country who are not equipped to deal with Ebola? What if a patient walks into an emergency room exhibiting symptoms aligned with Ebola? Do the nurses and doctors turn them away or risk their own lives? Called “hometown healthcare heroes” in an article exploring current Ebola protocol  the nurses in Dallas answered that question by risking their own lives  but is this truly what they signed up for when they pursued their career? While these are all questions that seemingly have no real answer right now  it is time to look at the healthcare workers and assess the impact this outbreak is having on their livelihood and those in training programs now trying to become nurses and doctors. The Washington Times,ebola-d509bdb0afc26eed8ed04f6530217a8510eea3aaa2c3cd04cd2cc14fa8ecc7e8,8,2931,2,2016-04-20 14:07:30.329513,

"Nurses (everywhere) are more at risk for contracting it because they are taking care of the patient with hands-on  intimate contact " National Nurses United (NNU) Co-president Deborah Burger said. NNU has vocally advocated for hospitals to better prepare nurses to handle Ebola patients.  Ebola concerns will likely increase respect for nurses as the vital role they play--and the risks they deal with--become clear  clinical nurse Theresa Brown  R.N.  wrote for CNN  citing the two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who contracted the disease caring for Thomas Eric Duncan  the first patient diagnosed with the virus in America.  In an effort to contain the deadly virus  National Coordinator for Health IT Karen DeSalvo will leave her post immediately to serve as Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell's acting assistant secretary for health  according to FierceHealthIT.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,397,healthcare impacts of ebola,196,provider impacts,3671,Health officials' response to Ebola compared to their reaction to hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) demonstrates a clear double standard  according to an opinion piece in Forbes.  While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has gone to extensive lengths to prevent the spread of Ebola  recently working with the White House administration to designate 35 hospitals nationwide as treatment centers for any patients who contract the virus  it has not made the same effort for HAIs such as C. diff.  writes Forbes contributor Robert Pearl  M.D.  the CEO of Permanente Medical Group. This is counterintuitive  Pearl writes  as 2011 alone saw 722 000 HAIs  which caused about 75 000 deaths.  Even in the face of these statistics  Pearl writes  healthcare workers find reasons not to practice proper hand hygiene before and after visiting a patient room. "Healthcare workers tell themselves it is not essential to wash if a patient seems healthy " he writes. "They may rationalize that it's too much trouble or that they don't have the time. But make no mistake  if improper hand hygiene put 14 000 caregivers at risk of dying  the culture and rules of healthcare would change rapidly."  This is particularly glaring amid the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) to safeguard healthcare workers against Ebola. American health authorities are overwhelming PPE manufacturers  with the CDC ordering nearly $3 million worth of the equipment. Pearl agrees that health leaders must do everything in their power to provide the necessary reosurces for caring for Ebola patients  but the same concern must also apply to efforts to stop HAIs. "No healthcare worker wants to hurt patients  but it happens. And all too often  the healthcare double standard is to blame " he writes.  ,ebola-8656df476773eaef1202d7d27851ecb68e294d210bad1be10729568d0ac0136c,0,1792,1,2016-04-20 15:48:38.951267,

People today don't think about patients that have HIV who are in beds down the hallway.  If you want a sound bite  it's this: We'll soon realize this is part of the global environment  that nothing is restrained by political boundaries.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5176,(RMW) associated with Ebola because of its highly infectious nature  the unprecedented volume of waste generated by this disease and the prospect of it spreading to pandemic proportions if not strictly contained.  After contacting several hazardous waste handling businesses  some declined to comment on this sensitive issue.  Stericycle  one of the largest hazardous waste handling companies in the U.S.  and the one that handled the Ebola medical waste from the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where 42 year old Thomas Eric Duncan died from Ebola on October 8  provided the following statement:  “It is Stericycle’s policy not to comment on the delivery of services for specific customers. However  we continue to work closely with our customers as well as federal  state and local agencies to address each potential and new Ebola case. While Stericycle has received national approval to transport Ebola-contaminated wastes  each incident is being handled on a case-by-case basis with extreme emphasis placed on protecting the general public  healthcare workers and our team members ” said Selin Hoboy  Stericycle’s vice president of legislative and regulatory affairs.  The largest Ebola outbreak to date is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa  which is centered in Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of November 2  2014  this outbreak has 13 042 reported cases resulting in 4 818 deaths.  All medical waste must be properly handled and be responsibly disposed of  but medical waste associated with the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)  a Category A infectious disease  is especially challenging for healthcare workers and medical waste disposal companies.  The patient’s profuse sweating and excretions of other bodily fluids cause widespread contamination to virtually everything in the treatment room and the head-to-toe personal protection equipment (PPE) worn by caregivers.  Current efforts to treat an infected person include giving either oral re-hydration therapy or intravenous fluids. The disease has a high risk of death  killing between 25 percent and 90 percent of those infected with the virus  averaging out at 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss  and typically follows 6 to 16 days after symptoms appear.  The virus spreads by direct contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected human or animal. Infection may also occur by direct contact with a recently contaminated item or surface. Spread of the disease through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.  The volume of medical waste associated with the disease is staggering. According to the Los Angeles Times  a single Ebola patient in a U.S. hospital will generate eight 55-gallon barrels or 440 gallons of medical waste each day. This includes virtually all material that comes in contact with the patient  like PPE worn by caregivers  bedding  instruments and food related materials. Even furniture  curtains and mattresses must be treated as contaminated.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend autoclaving or incineration of Ebola waste to destroy the microbes; however incinerating infected waste is banned in several states and must be transported to other states for incineration.  Transporting Ebola waste by road  rail or plane is also problematic. Under federal Department of Transportation (DOT) guidelines  Ebola waste is designated as a Class A infectious substance capable of causing death or disability  and requires a special permit for transport.  “The Ebola virus itself is not particularly hardy ” CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said recently before a Congressional hearing. “It’s killed by bleach  by autoclaving  or by a variety of chemicals.”  The Healthcare Coalition for Emergency Preparedness (HCEP)  an organization with the primary mission to raise awareness on healthcare facility operational sustainability during a crisis or emergency  is concerned about preparedness issues related to Ebola.  In a mid-October letter to a U.S. House of Representatives’ oversight hearing examining America’s public health response to the Ebola outbreak  Darrell A. Henry  executive director of HCEP outlined his organization’s recommendations for handling Ebola medical waste. Following are excerpts from that letter:  “We believe that there are simple solutions that can be implemented quickly  including designated treatment centers; utilize mobile triage centers; recommend more conservative protections for healthcare workers; establish protocols for patient movement; disinfect solid and liquid waste on-site as close to the source as possible; and consider deploying mobile waste sterilizers to medical centers.  “Additionally  with healthcare workers on the front lines in the battle to contain Ebola  the need for proper personal protective equipment and infection control protocols is paramount. We know that there is not much information and research on disease transmission in the healthcare setting  including the potential for infectious particles to be suspended in the air around a symptomatic patient. Thus  it only seems appropriate to adopt more conservative measures to protect healthcare providers.  “We are pleased to note that CDC has now clarified that Ebola waste is a Category A infectious material  which the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health  safety  and property when transported in commerce  and should not be treated like normal regulated medical waste.  “In addition to performing on-site sterilization of Ebola waste before it is removed from the facility  liquid Ebola waste should be disinfected before it is put into a municipal sewer system. CDC notes that the virus can be effectively killed with autoclave sterilization and bleach solutions  stating: “Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately inactivated or incinerated is no longer infectious.”  “It is important to know that  as recent as 20 to 25 years ago  most hospitals had on-site technology (incineration) to quickly and effectively destroy any contagious waste  but that was discontinued as a result of EPA regulations to reduce toxic emissions ” Henry continued. “Today  just 20 percent of hospitals have on-site technology (autoclaves). Most institutions outsource the treatment of medical waste  trucking it through communities to a central processing center. Nearly all of the top ranked medical institutions utilize on-site sterilization technology  which is readily available and affordable.  “At Emory Medical Center  one of the Ebola patients was producing up to 40 bags of contagious waste per day. If there was an outbreak  it would be unlikely that any truck transporter would have the capability  (i.e. Haz-Mat trucks  drivers  and DOT approved containers  etc.) to safely manage this deadly material. This situation would further be complicated by insurance and regulatory challenges as hospitals are legally liable for the disinfection of any waste they produce ” Henry said.  Sol Fried  president of Cyntox Biohazards Solutions  a company based in New York City that provides nationwide disposal services of medical and biohazardous waste said the company  like most med-waste disposal companies  is not fully prepared to handle Ebola material.  “Our company is not yet certified to pick up Ebola waste products  meaning anything that has come in contact with an Ebola patient ” Fried said. “The State of New Jersey has reached out to us for special training to be certified to pick up anything that has come in contact with Ebola. That is something we are in the process of doing  which will be done over the next week or so. Our employee training should not take more than a day and will take place online.  “At the current level we are not interested in handling Ebola medical waste. I don’t know if it’s worth the money at this time. If it becomes an epidemic then it may interest us  but I don’t see it becoming that. It seems more hysteria than a real need at this time. For small amounts it’s not economically viable for us.  “Most of our customers are contracted over three and five year agreements where we are picking on a weekly or monthly basis and our profit margins are very small. You only get profits in year two or three. So for one pickup of Ebola waste we could be charging lots of money  so it really does not make sense.  “It looks like the state is going to make sure everyone’s medical waste provider is permitted to pick up Ebola waste. That’s something we may have to do because the state is requiring state facilities to contract out to an Ebola certified waste handling company.  “The liabilities for handling Ebola waste are huge as well. We’d have to contact our insurance company prior to going into such an industry and it’s probably very expensive coverage ” Fried speculated.  Training healthcare workers to properly handle Ebola related waste is another major challenge. Many hospitals and med-waste companies rely on Compliance Publishing.Com for the latest information and guidance on Ebola. Alan Rosenauer  publisher of Compliance Publishing Corporation indicated that  Compliance has been helping companies in a variety of industries by developing and maintaining on-line searchable databases of compliance information that make compliance management easier.  “We don’t train companies; rather we provide information and guidance documents which come from organizations like the CDC  DOT and WHO ” Rosenauer explained. “At the Ebola Information Center on our website we provide the latest information to help medical waste companies  hospitals and clinics understand  handle  package and transport Ebola waste properly and safely. We also e-mail the information as well as post it on our website. In fact  we just published information and guidance for transporting bulk contaminated Ebola med-waste which was sent to everyone in the industry.  “Normally we send the information to just our customers  but right now we’re sending it to every medical waste transporter to make sure everyone is fully aware.  “Training can let someone know what the standards are. What the rules on conduct are  especially with Ebola. It’s not that they are not prepared  most of them are  but they don’t know exactly what they have to do to be compliant. Up until recently there was very little guidance on who needed to do what. What are the standards for packaging? What are the standards for transportation? Do you have to get a special permit to transport? Companies may still need a special permit  it’s just that DOT has recently provided guidelines on transporting bulk Category A waste ” Rosenauer concluded.  Much of the so called “Ebola Panic” has been created by the news media and let’s hope that cooler heads prevail and this deadly disease is contained and an effective treatment is found. Now is the time for everyone in the healthcare and waste disposal industries and governments at all levels to work together and concentrate on strict procedures and protocols to prevent the spread of Ebola  including protecting our borders from carriers of this infectious disease.

Caring for Ebola patients produces a mountain of potentially contaminated material. The disease causes substantial sweating  bleeding and vomiting and the virus can  via these bodily fluids  easily be transferred to medical equipment as well as protective gear worn by medical personnel.   The Los Angeles Times and others have reported that one Ebola patient treated in a US hospital would generate eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste per day.  As Ebola can be spread through direct contact with surfaces or equipment  including bed linen  which have been contaminated with infected body fluids  these must all be sterilised or destroyed after use.  Read: Ebola can jump from animals to people in Africa   Surprisingly  according to the World Health Organisation (WHO)  Ebola waste can be effectively disposed of using standard procedures for medical waste: the virus is not thought to be particularly hardy and can be eliminated relatively easily with heat  alcohol-based products and bleach.  However  because the virus is so highly virulent  and because its persistence in the environment outside the human body has not been extensively studied  many authorities – such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States – consider that only high-temperature destruction of waste  preferably by incineration  is acceptable.  But not all hospitals  even in first world contexts  are equipped with appropriate incineration facilities  which may require transporting waste to the few that do.

Upon removing the double-bagged waste from the patientâs room  the healthcare worker should place the double-bagged waste in a designated transport cart (for onsite inactivation or a rigid outer receptacle (with absorbent material and liner as described above  for offsite inactivation). The designated container should be located at the periphery of the area for taking off PPE so that removal from the area is efficient and does not create a risk of recontamination of the outer container. Environmental services personnel removing the waste from the care area should only handle the outer container/transport cart and should never open the container or handle the double-bagged waste. PPE should be used according to the OSHA PPE Selection Matrix for Occupational Exposure to Ebola Virus [PDF - 3 pages]. For onsite inactivation  environmental services personnel wearing appropriate PPE according to the OSHA PPE Selection Matrix for Occupational Exposure to Ebola Virus [PDF - 3 pages] should: Safely transfer waste in a transport cart to dedicated waste autoclave room or secured storage location. Refer to http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/survivability-ebola-medical-waste.html for guidance on inactivation of Ebola virus in waste. For offsite inactivation  refer to U.S. DOT Guidance for Transporting Ebola Contaminated Items  a Category A Infectious Substance: Before removal from the area  the healthcare workers wearing appropriate PPE should close the liner (either by zip tie or similar means of closure as specified by the manufacturer of the packaging)  and close the outer lid and packaging. Disinfect the entire exterior surface of the container with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant (wipe or spray). Environmental services personnel wearing appropriate PPE according to the OSHA PPE Selection Matrix for Occupational Exposure to Ebola Virus [PDF - 3 pages] should secure the outer lid and packaging and apply the special Category A DOT Waste labels provided and as directed by the manufacturer of the packaging. Safely transport to a designated and secure storage area that is preferably isolated and with limited access for approved waste vendor pickup. Procedures for Handling Liquid Waste (Body Fluids Including Blood  Urine  Vomit  Feces)  Consult with State or local regulations regarding pretreatment of waste. Sanitary sewers may be used for the safe disposal of patient waste. Reference CDCâs Interim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals for Ebola Virus; WHO Infection prevention and control guidance for care of patients in health-care settings  with focus on Ebola  2014 [PDF - 24 pages].  Primary handling of liquid waste should occur in the patientâs room and be performed by the primary healthcare workers (i.e.  doctors and nurses) wearing recommended PPE as designated in the guidance for hospitals. Pour waste  avoiding splashing by pouring from a low level  into the toilet. Close the lid first  and then flush toilet. Clean and disinfect flush handles  toilet seat  and lid surfaces with EPA-registered hospital disinfectant/cleaner. Discard cleaning cloths in biohazard bags. Discard emesis and portable toileting containers as solid waste. Follow recommended procedures for disinfecting visibly soiled PPE and removal of PPE. Handling Spills: Basic principles for spills of blood and other potentially infectious materials are outlined in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogen Standard  29 CFR 1910.1030 and guidance for Bloodborne Pathogens and Needlestick Prevention.  Spills should be managed by the doctors and nurses caring for the Ebola patient and by wearing recommended PPE as designated in the guidance for hospitals. Isolate the area of the spill; do not let other individuals access the area until disinfection is completed. Place absorbent material on the spill (a solidifier agent can be used). Pour the EPA-registered disinfectant over the spill and allow sufficient contact time (according to manufacturerâs instructions for treating spills). Use disposable absorbent towels to remove bulk spill material. Dispose of the towels in a biohazard bag as specified above. Apply the EPA-registered hospital disinfectant to the cleaned surface and allow the specified contact time. Use disposable cleaning cloths or wipes to wipe the treated area. Follow handling of solid waste protocol as described above to discard materials used for containing the spill and for cleaning and disinfection. Follow recommended procedures for disinfecting visibly soiled PPE and taking off PPE.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5197,This document is intended to provide hospitals and healthcare providers with key information about the safe handling  transport  and disposal of waste generated from the care of patients under investigation (PUIs) for or with confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD).  Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed EVD is subject to procedures set forth by local  state and Federal regulations. Basic principles for spills of blood and other potentially infectious materials are outlined in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogen standard  29 CFR 1910.1030. Waste contaminated (or suspected to be contaminated) with Ebola virus is a Category A infectious substance regulated as a hazardous material under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 C.F.R.  Parts 171-180). Requirements in the HMR apply to any material DOT determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health  safety  and property when transported in commerce1. For off-site commercial transport of Ebola-associated waste  strict compliance with the HMR is required. If a person requires a variance to the HMR  that person must apply for a Special Permit under 49 CFR Â§ 107.105. DOT may grant a special permit if the applicant can demonstrate an alternative packaging will achieve a safety level that is: (1) at least equal to the safety level required under the HMR  or (2) consistent with the public interest if a required safety level does not exist. DOT has granted multiple special permits authorizing the transportation in commerce of certain Ebola-associated waste. Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately incinerated  autoclaved  or otherwise inactivated is not infectious  does not pose a health risk  and is not considered to be regulated medical waste or a hazardous material under Federal law. Therefore  such waste no longer is considered a Category A infectious substance and is not subject to the requirements of the HMR. Inactivation or incineration of Ebola-associated waste within a hospital system may be subject to state  local and OSHA regulations. On-site inactivation Ebola-associated waste may be inactivated through the use of appropriate autoclaves. Other methods of inactivation (e.g.  chemical inactivation) have not been standardized and would need to consider worker safety issues  as well as the potential for triggering other Federal safety regulations. On-site incineration Ebola-associated waste may be incinerated. The products of incineration (i.e.  the ash) can be transported and disposed of in accordance with state and local regulations and standard protocols for hospital waste disposal. Ebola-associated waste disposal is subject to state and local regulations. Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately inactivated or incinerated is not infectious and is not considered to be regulated medical waste or a hazardous material under Federal law.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5200,The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit  located at the Nebraska Medical Center  shares best practices for Ebola waste removal  in a commentary published in in the December issue of the American Journal of Infection Control.  One of the key areas of concern related to the treatment of Ebola patients in the United States is waste removal. According to the case study  Ebola patients treated by the Nebraska team produced about 23 cubic feet – more than 50 pounds – of solid waste per day  most of which was personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by healthcare workers. Additionally  the patients produced approximately 2.3 gallons of liquid waste per day.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation  which regulates hazardous material  Ebola waste is considered category A – meaning the waste is known or expected to contain a pathogen that is capable of causing fatal disease. Waste in this category requires many steps  and even a special permit  to ensure safe disposal.  The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit developed a strategy to convert the category A waste into category B medical waste  to enable safe disposal. This was done by transferring all solid waste  including PPE  patient linens  scrubs  towels  etc.  to a pass-through autoclave system. After it was sterilized by the autoclave  the waste was placed in biohazard bags and into rigid packaging to be disposed of as category B medical waste.  Liquid waste produced by the Ebola patient was disposed of into a toilet with hospital-grade disinfectant and held for 2.5 times the recommended time before flushing the waste. This method was fully vetted by numerous stakeholders and surpasses the CDC guidance regarding Ebola liquid waste removal.  This case study seeks to provide other hospitals and facilities with guidance on the best practices associated with Ebola waste removal.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5201,Key Points:  Effective disinfectant product(s): Currently  no EPA-registered hospital disinfectant products will have a statement on the label that specifically says it can kill Ebola virus. Â Use an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims for hospital disinfection (or the equivalent microbial pathogen claims) and claims against non-enveloped viruses (e.g.  norovirus  rotavirus  adenovirus  poliovirus). Â These products are broadly antiviral and capable of inactivating both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses including Ebola virus. Â These disinfectants should be used in accordance with the manufacturerâs labeled instructions. Â   One simple way to identify an appropriate product effective against Ebola virus is to use a product included in EPAâs List L: Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virus.  Level of cleaning and decontamination: Once a person has been confirmed to have Ebola  the way to decontaminate the residence depends on the personâs symptoms at the time they were in the residence: Cleaning by residents - If the person with Ebola only had a fever with no gastrointestinal (e.g.  diarrhea  vomiting) or hemorrhagic (bleeding) symptoms while he or she was in the residence  the person should not be contaminating their environment. The remaining members of the residence can clean and launder as normal using detergent and/or disinfectant. Cleaning by contract company - If the person with Ebola had a fever AND diarrhea  vomiting  and/or unexplained bleeding  public health and/or assigned authorities may need to contact a contract company who will assess the residence to determine the proper decontamination and disposal procedures. Remaining members of the residence should avoid contaminated rooms and areas until after the completion of the assessment and decontamination. Which contract companies can conduct the cleaning?: Companies with experience in cleaning biohazard and crimes scenes. OSHA provides guidance for cleaning and decontaminating in non-healthcare settings. Any contract company conducting such work must comply with the its stateâs Ebola policies and with OSHA standards for  among others that may apply  bloodborne pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030)  personal protective equipment (PPE) (29 CFR 1910.132)  respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134)  and hazard communication (29 CFR 1910.1200) (e.g.  for chemical hazards). In states that operate their own occupational safety and health programs  different or additional requirements may exist. Transport of waste: Transportation of Ebola-contaminated waste (i.e.  materials that cannot be decontaminated and were in contact with the person with Ebola having fever AND diarrhea  vomiting  and/or unexplained bleeding) must be packaged and transported in accordance with regulations on the transportation of Ebola contaminated items provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT): U.S. DOT Hazardous Materials Regulation for Category A Infectious Substance. If a contract company is handling the waste  requirements in OSHA standards  including Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030) may also apply. Definitions:  Contract company: A company hired to complete a needed task. In regards to decontaminating residences of Ebola virus  the contract company will be specialized in decontaminating  handling  and discarding of toxic chemicals  infectious agents  etc. with experience in cleaning biohazard or crime scenes and comply with all health and safety regulations. These companies may be certified through such associations as the National Institute of Decontamination Specialists (NIDS)  Institute of Inspection  Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC)  American Bio Recovery Association (ABRA)  or complete training as outline in the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard (HAZWOPER). Disinfection product: A product that will make certain biological agents inactive. Specific to Ebola  use an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant or one with the equivalent microbial pathogen claims that also have a label claim against a non-enveloped virus. Such products are included in EPAâs List L: Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virus. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Equipment worn to prevent exposure to hazardous substances (e.g.  chemicals  infectious agents  particles). Â For Ebola decontamination  the level of PPE will vary due to the contamination level and chemicals used for cleaning and decontaminating. Refer to the OSHA PPE Selection Matrix for Occupational Exposure to Ebola Virus for appropriate PPE and related recommendations in the CDC âGuidance on Personal Protective Equipment To Be Used by Healthcare Workers During Management of Patients with Ebola Virus Disease in U.S. Hospitals  Including Procedures for Putting On (Donning) and Removing (Doffing).â Decontamination and waste disposal â Determined by the symptoms of the person confirmed with Ebola while they were within the residence  (1) Remaining members of residences where a person with Ebola only had a fever with no gastrointestinal (e.g.  diarrhea  vomiting) or hemorrhagic (bleeding) symptoms  can clean and launder as normal because the individual should not be contaminating their environment.  (2) Remaining members of residences where a person with Ebola had a fever AND diarrhea  vomiting  and/or unexplained bleeding should have local public health and/or assigned authorities for Ebola emergency response managing the decontamination and waste disposal through a contract company. Members of the residence (or property owners  if the residence is rented) should not handle contaminated materials; do not touch any body fluids or soiled surfaces and materials.  The public health authorities can assist in finding a qualified contract company. Any contract company conducting such work must comply with the its stateâs Ebola policies and with OSHA standards for  among others that may apply  bloodborne pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030)  personal protective equipment (PPE) (29 CFR 1910.132)  respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134)  and hazard communication (29 CFR 1910.1200) (e.g.  for chemical hazards). In states that operate their own occupational safety and health programs  different or additional requirements may exist. The contract company will assess the residence to determine the proper decontamination and disposal procedures. Only areas/rooms with contamination from diarrhea  vomiting  unexplained bleeding  and/or other body fluids  will need to be cleaned and disinfected.  ,ebola-c57812f51bdf5852f6679757c813040663bf7646c3be357759f85ba6f7ae35c1,0,6597,2,2016-04-25 11:41:30.494868,

Always use wet towels when cleaning the floor in patient care areas. Do not dry sweep. Sweeping can cause infectious droplets to go into the air. Always use disposable towels and mops to clean. Always pour chlorine onto disposable towels. Never dip disposable towels into a bucket of chlorine; dipping a dirty towel into a clean chlorine solution will make the solution less effective. ,ebola-b1bc66b0e46c2bf2b09a3e8dbb191834ba598ea412148cb7281129b55c8343e2,0,782,2,2016-04-25 11:45:25.319262,

For nonporous surfaces (door handles  tile floors)  use an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant or a disinfectant with equivalent microbial pathogen claims according to manufacturerâs instructions with a label claim against a nonenveloped virus  such as norovirus  rotavirus  adenovirus  or poliovirus. One simple way to identify an appropriate product effective against Ebola virus is to use a product included in EPAâs List L: Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virus. Any EPA-registered disinfectant that is effective against a nonenveloped virus will also be effective against Ebola virus.Â  Porous materials (linens  carpet  mattress  pillows) should be properly contained and disposed of according to regulations set by the state where the waste is located. Store the properly contained contaminated material in a room that is not being used until it can be collected for disposal. Additional CDC recommendations for Ebola Medical Waste Management provides further information about safe handling and disposal of medical waste from patients under investigation or patients with confirmed EVD.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5214,Representational image. Agencies Waste management companies are refusing to haul away the soiled sheets and virus-spattered protective gear associated with treating the disease  citing federal guidelines that require Ebola-related waste to be handled in special packaging by people with hazardous materials training  infectious disease and biosafety experts told Reuters. Many US hospitals are unaware of the regulatory snafu  which experts say could threaten their ability to treat any person who develops Ebola in the US after coming from an infected region. It can take as long as 21 days to develop Ebola symptoms after exposure. The issue created problems for Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  the first institution to care for Ebola patients here. As Emory was treating two US missionaries who were evacuated from West Africa in August  their waste hauler  Stericycle  initially refused to handle it. Stericycle declined comment. Ebola symptoms can include copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhea  and nurses and doctors at Emory donned full hazmat suits to protect themselves. Bags of waste quickly began to pile up. "At its peak  we were up to 40 bags a day of medical waste  which took a huge tax on our waste management system " Emory's Dr. Aneesh Mehta told colleagues at a medical meeting earlier this month. Emory sent staff to Home Depot to buy as many 32-gallon rubber waste containers with lids that they could get their hands on. Emory kept the waste in a special containment area for six days until its Atlanta neighbor  the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  helped broker an agreement with Stericycle. While US hospitals may be prepared clinically to care for a patient with Ebola  Emory's experience shows that logistically they are far from ready  biosafety experts said. "Our waste management obstacles and the logistics we had to put in place were amazing " Patricia Olinger  director of environmental health and safety at Emory  said in an interview. The worst Ebola outbreak on record is now projected to infect as many as 20 000 people in West Africa by November  while US officials have said that number could rise above 5 50 000 by mid-January without an international intervention to contain its spread. Experts say it is only a matter of time before at least some infected patients are diagnosed in US hospitals  most likely walking into the emergency department seeking treatment. Already there have been several scares. As of 8 September  as many as 10 patients have been tested by US hospitals for suspected Ebola cases  Dr Barbara Knust  team leader for the CDC's Ebola response  said at a medical meeting this month. All tested negative. The CDC has issued detailed guidelines on how hospitals can care for such patients  but their recommendations for handling Ebola waste differs from the US Department of Transportation  which regulates the transportation of infectious waste. CDC advises hospitals to place Ebola-infected items in leak-proof containers and discard them as they would other biohazards that fall into the category of "regulated medical waste." According to DOT guidelines  items in this category can't be in a form that can cause human harm. The DOT classifies Ebola as a Category A agent  or one that is potentially life-threatening. DOT regulations say transporting Category A items requires special packaging and hazmat training. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency isn't aware of any packaging that is approved for handling Ebola waste. As a result  conventional waste management contractors believe they can't legally haul Ebola waste  said Thomas Metzger  communication director for the National Waste & Recycling Association trade group. TEMPORARY FIX Part of Emory's solution was to bring in one of the university's large-capacity sterilisers called an autoclave  which uses pressurised steam to neutralise infectious agents  before handing the waste off to its disposal contractor for incineration. Few hospitals have the ability to autoclave medical waste from Ebola patients on site. "For this reason  it would be very difficult for a hospital to agree to care for Ebola cases - this desperately needs a fix " said Dr Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Public Health Committee. Dr Gavin Macgregor-Skinner  an expert on public health preparedness at Pennsylvania State University  said there's "no way in the world" that US hospitals are ready to treat patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola. "Where they come undone every time is the management of their liquid and solid waste " said Macgregor-Skinner  who recently trained healthcare workers in Nigeria on behalf of the Elizabeth R Griffin Research Foundation. Skinner said the CDC is working with DOT to resolve the issue. He said the CDC views its disposal guidelines as appropriate  and that they have been proven to prevent infection in the handling of waste from HIV  hepatitis  and tuberculosis patients. Joe Delcambre  a spokesman for DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  could not say whether requiring hospitals to first sterilize Ebola waste would resolve the issue for waste haulers. He did confirm that DOT is meeting with CDC. Metzger said his members are also meeting with officials from the DOT  the CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency to sort out the issue. Until the matter is resolved  however  "We're bound by those regulations " he said.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5272,The world’s top health agencies have issued strict protocols on the disposal of solid waste from Ebola Patients. The University of Pittsburgh’s Kyle Bibby said there’s also some guidance on the disposal of liquid medical waste.  “The World Health Organization first issued a statement that it was appropriate to dispose of liquid waste from Ebola patients directly in sanitary sewers or pit latrine without any other treatment. And then the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. followed that guidance and continues to follow that guidance ” he said.  But when several people in the U.S. were treated for Ebola some questioned whether that guidance offered enough protection.  “There was lots of concern from sewage workers about going down into sewers. Would they be exposed to Ebola? What’s an appropriate personal protective care? So the Centers for Disease Control stated that Ebola survives on the order of minutes in water and is almost instantly or very  very rapidly inactivated. And when we looked to the literature we didn’t find any evidence of that ” he said.  Bibby is an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering. He and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh and Drexel University did not say the CDC is wrong. They just said that there’s an apparent lack of evidence.  The guidance may be based on the type of virus Ebola is – an enveloped virus. That means it has a membrane or wrapping  which actually comes from an infected cell. But Bibby said enveloped viruses usually don’t fair too well when exposed to liquids. Take the AIDS virus.  “For example  some of the studies that have been done  like on HIV  found that HIV’s survival in water is negligible. It dies very  very quickly. And HIV is an enveloped virus and I think that this is probably one of the lines of evidence that’s been used ” said Bibby.  The National Science Foundation has awarded the researchers a $100 000 grant to study the issue further.  Bibby said  “We don’t have firm guidance and guidelines on disposal of infectious liquid waste  period. And whether that’s from a hospital or funeral homes or other places  other medical facilities  there’s not sort of a concrete guideline on how to dispose of all this.”  Researchers will use viruses that are physically similar to Ebola and test their survival rates in water and wastewater.   ,ebola-c27ca266153fb7e8c8308620449a8d8cf228c6c72f796a3fb71d3e978cdc67c2,0,2353,2,2016-04-25 13:01:21.290082,

The sterilizing machine  known as an autoclave  decontaminates used medical equipment and waste such as syringes  personal protective suits and gloves through several cycles of high-pressure steam and vacuuming  allowing for their safe disposal.  It is the first of its kind in any of the Ebola-affected countries and is now functioning at the Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) at Police Training School Treatment Centre Two in Hastings and No. 34 Military Hospital in Freetown.  âThis isnât just a massive step ahead in terms of helping medical teams deal with the Ebola virus and ending the disease. It should also be a best practice for disposing of medical waste in general â said Magdy MartÃ­nez-SolimÃ¡n  Director of the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support at UNDP.  âThis is an investment in the future which Ebola-affected countries will benefit from long after the crisis has ended â he added. The highly infectious nature of the Ebola virus means that special full-body suits that health workers  burial teams and other responders use have to be sterilized  or destroyed after a single use.  Autoclaves present an alternative to burning waste in open pits  barrels  or inexpensive incinerators without air pollution control equipment  which produce dangerous fumes and expose workers to flames.  âIt is our responsibility to help medical teams manage public health risks and the environment responsibly â said David McLachlan-Karr  the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Sierra Leone. âWeâve seen the autoclaves at work and they are definitely going to improve the quality of life for communities living in the vicinity.â  With autoclaves  medical waste is processed in safe barrels designed to minimize contact and comes out as a dry and sterile plastic mass less than half the initial volume. The equipment requires electricity and water for the internal steam generator  and a small drain for releasing sterilized liquids and steam.  âItâs very easy to use â said Private Kargbo Kanbeh  public health officer for 34 Military Hospital. âI know itâs just about two things: temperature  pressure  temperature  pressure. Everything is manual. Itâs very good for Africa. Itâs very fast.â  The autoclave was designed under a UNDP/GEF project and is manufactured by a South African company  Mediclave to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS  hepatitis B and C  tuberculosis and other diseases that can be transmitted through infectious waste.  UNDP is working to roll out the technology to 11 treatment centers across Sierra Leone and plans to send some units to Guinea and Liberia  the other two most-affected countries. The initiative  worth USD 4 million  is partially cost-shared by the Government of South Korea.  ,ebola-8801e21da2b0b59d7597d62aa8ca1b279ba423664dc8d1d280378fe9df6ab554,0,3116,2,2016-04-25 13:02:42.757511,

New York - Handling medical waste generated by an Ebola patient proved to be one of the contingencies that US hospitals were unprepared for  a top US health official said  adding that it “took longer than we would have wished” to fix the problem.  The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) thought the disposal issue was resolved on September 26  just two days before the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States was admitted to a Dallas hospital after initially being turned away.  “But it wasn't ” said Dr. Thomas Frieden  director of CDC told reporters at a news conference.  In short  conflicting classifications on Ebola waste forced the hospital to wait for the US Department of Transportation to issue a special permit before it could move the material.  The permit finally came through on Friday  allowing Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital  which is caring for patient Thomas Duncan to transport and dispose of medical waste such as vomit and diarrhoea generated during his stay.  While waiting  the Dallas hospital has held the waste at the unit where Duncan is in isolation  said Dr. David Lakey  commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services.  County officials have contracted with a disposal company that has received approval to transport the waste  Lakey said on Saturday  but is waiting until after the weekend to remove the items from the hospital.  Conflicting US regulations on transporting such waste caused officials to scramble even before the Dallas Ebola case.  Few US hospitals are equipped with incinerators or large sterilisers called autoclaves needed to safely handle soiled linens  contaminated syringes and virus-spattered protective gear generated from the care of an Ebola patient. The waste needs to be treated before it can travel over public roads.  The CDC advises hospitals to treat items infected with the Ebola virus in leak-proof containers and discard them as they would other regulated medical waste.  However  the Transportation Department classifies Ebola as a Category A infectious agent  meaning it is capable of killing people  rather than as regulated medical waste  which includes non-lethal pathogens. - Reuters  Hungry for more scitech news?

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5287,Daniel Bausch is an Ebola expert  and he’s got bad news for you: It’s time to start thinking about medical waste associated with Ebola care.  Patients with this debilitating virus produce 440 gallons of medical waste daily  including instruments  gowns  gloves  body fluids  sheets  mattresses and more. That’s a substantial amount of medical waste in any situation  but it’s especially daunting in this case because it needs to be disposed of extremely cautiously  to avoid the risk of spreading infection. What do you do with a problem like Ebola waste? Because you don’t want to toss it in the garbage.  Somewhat surprisingly  says Bausch  the United States actually faces bigger problems when it comes to safely disposing of Ebola waste  which is simply burned in large pits in Africa: “In the United States  of course  we are somewhat beholden to higher tech solutions  which in some ways are a little bit more problematic in terms of treating all that waste  and we need autoclaves or incinerators that can handle that sort of thing. It’s not the actual inactivation that’s particularly difficult; it’s just the process of getting the waste from  of course  the frontline of care and interaction with the patients safely to the place where it can be incinerated or autoclaved.”  The problem in the United States is ironically compounded by the increased access to medical care  and the higher quality of medical services  available. In the United States  patients are treated by medical teams with access to a huge volume of supplies they use for protection  including masks  gowns  booties  and gloves  along with sanitizers and other tools. Moreover  patients receive extensive medical interventions that generate waste like needles  tubing  medical tape  empty IV bags  and more. The very care that has helped most of the handful of Ebola patients in the United States conquer the disease has contributed to the huge amount of waste generated  highlighting a critical hole in U.S. medical infrastructure — while African hospitals may have lacked the supplies and personnel needed to supply aid to Ebola patients  they’re at least prepared to handle the waste.  The CDC just issued guidelines to help clinicians and administrators decide upon how to handle Ebola waste  but The New York Times notes that many facilities don’t have the autoclave  and incinerator  capacity to handle medical waste on this scale. Some states prohibit the burning of medical waste altogether  or have barred incineration of Ebola waste  leading to the transport of waste across state borders to facilities that can handle it  which poses its own risks; with every mile added to transport  there’s a greater risk of spreading disease to previously unexposed communities.  Surprisingly  defenders of burning the waste come from surprising corners. Environmentals like Allen Hershkowitz  National Resources Defense Council senior scientist  point out that: “There’s no pollutant that’s going to come out of a waste incinerator that’s more dangerous than the Ebola virus. When you’re dealing with pathogenic and biological hazards  sometimes the safest thing to do is combustion.”  The argument in defense of incineration can be bolstered by the fact that medical waste companies specialize in high-efficiency incineration with equipment designed to minimize and trap byproducts of combustion  reducing overall pollution considerably. Fears about Ebola  rather than genuine environmental or public health concerns  are driving the decision to push against incineration of ebola waste in many regions  but eventually  the United States is going to have to face facts: The mounting waste that accumulates in facilities where Ebola patients receive treatments needs to be disposed of safely  and promptly.  ,ebola-5ca94959e81e07712fe34e9b5532bd46a664d50af74600c1cdaf659ca0c29321,0,3788,2,2016-04-25 13:07:29.616084, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5289,The U.S. government is days away from settling the critical question of how hospitals should handle and dispose of medical waste from Ebola patients  reports News Daily.  Currently  conflicting regulations over how Ebola waste should be transported could make it very difficult for U.S. hospitals to safely care for patients.  "Most U.S. hospitals are not equipped with incinerators or large sterilizers called autoclaves that could accommodate the large amounts of soiled linens and clothes  and contaminated syringes and protective gear " said Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Public Health Committee.  Sterilizing Ebola waste before it is transported is important not only to protect waste haulers  but to guard against someone using the waste "for nefarious purposes " said Sean Kaufman  ‎president of Behavioral-Based Improvement Solutions  an Atlanta-based biosafety firm.  Cynthia Quarterman  administrator of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration  which oversees dangerous shipments  said her agency is "working on how we can clarify even further for hospitals  for the public  what the appropriate transportation should be."  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises hospitals to treat items infected with the Ebola virus in leak-proof containers and discard them as they would other biohazards that fall into the category of "regulated medical waste."  But the D.O.T. considers Ebola a Category A infectious agent  meaning it is capable of killing people and animals  and not "regulated medical waste " a category in which pathogens are not capable of causing harm.  Waste management contractors who normally handle hazardous hospital waste say they cannot legally haul the material  which leaves hospitals stuck without a way to dispose of the waste.  When Emory University Hospital in Atlanta was preparing to care for two U.S. missionaries infected with Ebola in West Africa in its high-security biocontainment unit  their waste hauler  Stericycle  initially refused to handle it. Bags of Ebola waste quickly began piling up until the hospital worked out the issues.  C.D.C. spokesman Tom Skinner said the waste management problem has not been resolved yet  but he has said previously that the C.D.C. is meeting with officials at the D.O.T. to resolve the matter. Duchin said he has heard that the discussion "has been elevated at the fed to decision makers who can solve the problem."  Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas is currently treating the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed on U.S. soil.  "The C.D.C. and D.O.T. will likely issue joint decision soon " said a D.O.T. official.

The special permit will cover all of Texas  not just waste originating at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas  which is beneficial should another diagnosed case present itself in the state.Â  The special permit also extends to the removal of household hazardous material  including the patientâs home.Â  Special permits are issued to individual companies to ensure that each holder is fit to conduct the activity authorized. PHMSA has been in proactive discussions with CDC to prepare guidance to address emerging issues elsewhere in the United States should they develop.  The special permit issued today offers Stericycle  Inc. two alternative options for packaging the waste material prior to transport. Both options require a series of inner and outer packaging and the application of a CDC-authorized disinfectant to the inner packaging. The special permit also provides instructions for operation controls during transport  and requires the carrier to maintain a written spill response plan with guidelines for protecting employees and decontaminating any released material in the event of an accident.Â  For more information about the special permit  please click here.  The Hazardous Materials Regulations authorizes the issuance of special permits that allow a company or individual to package or ship hazardous materials in a manner that varies from existing regulations but maintains an equivalent level of safety. Solid materials contaminated with the Ebola virus are classified as Category A infectious substances according to the Hazardous Materials Regulations. Current safety regulations governing the transport of Category A infectious substances require packaging that may not be always suited for the transport of larger quantities of contaminated waste.Â  The treatment of Ebola patients creates a relatively large quantity of contaminated medical waste.  While the U.S. Department of Transportationâs PHMSA approves the special permit to Stericycle  the contract for services is between the company and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.Â  All questions related to the terms of the contract and operational logistics such as the costs  the times of pick up  disposal locations  the volume of materials  etc. should be answered by the state of Texas health officials or the hospital.  ###  DOT 94-14,ebola-f5542695307ca6ba4965e94a2ab6b5227f05cc3e8882dc91cc15d6beeceb3f4b,0,2892,2,2016-04-25 13:11:25.539732,

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,257,disposal of ebola medical waste,5508,Background  Given the systems currently in place to identify people with Ebola virus disease (EVD)  any Ebola-related deaths in the United States would likely occur within a hospital setting. The Ebola virus can be detected throughout the bodies of patients who die of the disease. Ebola can be transmitted in postmortem care settings by laceration and puncture with contaminated instruments used during postmortem care  through direct handling of human remains without recommended PPE  and through splashes of blood or other body fluids such as urine  saliva  feces  or vomit to unprotected mucosa such as eyes  nose  or mouth during postmortem care.  This guidance is based on current knowledge of Ebola. Check CDCâs Ebola website frequently for updated information. Guidance for specific occupational groups that may have risks of exposure to Ebola is also available on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Ebola website and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Ebola website.  In addition to federal laws and guidelines that apply to mortuary workers  mortuary practices and workers may also be subject to a variety of state  tribal  territorial  and local regulations. Consult officials or licensed attorneys in your jurisdiction for additional guidance on laws that affect mortuary practices. CDC recommends close collaboration with public health officials in the state or local jurisdiction  as well as with the licensed funeral director who has agreed to accept the bagged remains  to safely implement each step of the process.  Key Points  Ebola virus can be transmitted in postmortem care settings through unsafe handling of remains. Ensure that only personnel trained in handling infected human remains and wearing recommended PPE touch or move any remains that contain Ebola virus. Do not wash or clean the body. Do not embalm the body. Do not perform an autopsy. If an autopsy is necessary  consult the state health department and CDC regarding necessary precautions. Do not remove any inserted medical equipment from the body such as intravenous (IV) lines  endotracheal or other tubing  or implanted electronic medical devices. Cremate the body. If cremation cannot be done because of safety concerns  the body should be buried in a standard metal casket or other comparable burial method. Definitions for Terms Used in this Guidance  If a hospital has a patient with EVD  hot and cold safety zones should already be established. Thus  hospitals with an Ebola-related death should be familiar with the following terminology.  Hot zone â contaminated area that includes the patient treatment room. Only workers wearing PPE that conforms to CDCâs Guidance on Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers are allowed to be in this area. Cold zone â noncontaminated area used for planning and staging. Only workers who have not entered the hot zone or who have properly doffed their PPE after being in the hot zone are permitted in the cold zone. Workers put on clean PPE in the cold zone under the direction of a trained observer. Cremation â the act of reducing human remains to ash by intense heat. Leakproof bag â a body bag that is puncture-resistant and sealed in a manner to contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids during handling  transport  or shipping. Equipment List  The following equipment should be used in the hot zone:  Hospital gurney containing three pre-opened cremation-compatible body bags with the following specifications: First bag (top layer on gurney): vinyl or other chlorine-free material  minimum of 6 mil thickness (152 micrometers). To prevent any leakage of fluids  all seams should be factory heat-sealed or welded  not sewn  and the zipper should be on top. Second bag (middle layer on gurney): chlorine-free material impervious to fluids that can be heat-sealed around the body to form a leakproof body bag. This bag should be specifically designed for the containment and transport of infectious bodies. The material should be precut to provide sufficient material to envelop the body and first bag. Third bag (bottom layer on gurney): laminated vinyl or other chlorine-free material  minimum of 18 mil thickness (457 micrometers) with handles that are not sewn on  such as riveted handles reinforced with handle straps that run under the pouch. To prevent any leakage of fluids  all seams should be factory heat-sealed or welded  not sewn  and the zipper should be on top. Thermal sealer for sealing the second bag PPE recommended for personnel entering the room of a patient with EVD as described in CDCâs Guidance on Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers Scissors for cutting excess material from heat-sealed bag Camera or mobile phone capable of securely transferring photographs electronically via Wi-Fi  e-mail  or text message U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectant and wipes with a label-claim for use against a nonenveloped virus Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) Red biohazard bag for medical waste Zip tie for locking the third bag shut at the zipper Enlarged copy of the Mortuary Guidance Job Aid: Postmortem Preparation in a Hospital Room [PDF - 1 page] and tape for posting these step-by-step guidelines to a wall in the hot zone The following equipment should be used in the cold zone:  Hospital gurney or mortuary stretcher Adhesive-backed pouch that is applied to the decontaminated body bag Single-use (disposable) gloves with extended cuffs and a long-sleeved disposable gown Biohazard spill kit  including: recommended PPE  absorbent materials such as paper towels  kitty litter or a solidifier  an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant  and biohazard waste bags Infectious substance labels that are applied to the decontaminated body bag. These include the following: Black and white âinfectious substanceâ label United Nations (UN) 2814 label âDo not openâ label Name and phone number of the hospital administrator,ebola-2834e8249bad50c1290b45b663c5dd797642691381123f2b1100b500528fd3e7,0,6020,2,2016-04-26 09:05:35.074709,

Experts fear this could cause huge problems should Ebola get to the United States.  Emory University Hospital in Atlanta treated both the US missionaries that were infected with Ebola. Stericycle  their contracted waste removal company refused to remove anything that had been in contact with the patients  citing Federal regulations.  With up to 40 bags of Ebola contaminated clinical waste a day being produced  staff at Emory had to use their own initiative to deal with the issue.  Emory Hospital staff were despatched to Home Depot and instructed to buy as many 32 gallon rubber waste barrels with lids as they could get their hands on. They then packed the waste into the barrels and kept them in a containment area for SIX DAYS until the problem was resolved.  âOur waste management obstacles and the logistics we had to put in place were amazing â Patricia Olinger  director of environmental health and safety at Emory  said in an interview.  The CDC stepped in and eventually Stericycle removed the waste. The issue has occurredÂ because of Department of Transport rules on how Category A clinical waste can be transported and who it can be transported by.  Category A waste requires special packaging and those moving the waste  and transporting it has to have full Hazmat training. The CDC state there is no recommended packaging that is no packaging that is currently approved for transporting Ebola waste and this is what lead to Stericycle refusing to handle the waste materials.  The Emory University Hospital was able to sterilize all the waste in a massive autoclave before handing it over to Stericycle for incineration…but very few hospitals have the ability to do this on site  which leads back to the transportation issues.  âFor this reason  it would be very difficult for a hospital to agree to care for Ebola cases â this desperately needs a fix â said Dr Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of Americaâs Public Health Committee.  Dr Gavin Macgregor-Skinner  an expert on public health preparedness at Pennsylvania State University  said thereâs âno way in the worldâ that US hospitals are ready to treat patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola.Â (my emphasis)  The Department of Â Transport and The National Waste Recycling Association are in talks with the CDC in an attempt to resolve the situation but in the meantime both groups insist they are bound by the regulations.  If two patients generate 40 bags a day of infectious waste you can imagine what 20 patients would generate  or 200…  Learn how to better prepare for pandemicsÂ and other short and long term disasters.

These permits can later be extended for up to two years.  Advanced Environmental Options (AEO)  one of the approved companies  has had two training sessions for employees on treating Ebola waste  account manager Dana West said. The employees have been trained on what equipment to wear.    AEO has previous experience handling Category A waste  a classification by the Transportation Department  meaning that it is capable of killing people and animals  West further added.  The four other companies include Veolia ES Technical Solutions LLC  Stericyle Inc.  Triumvirate Environmental Inc. and Smith Systems Transportation Inc.  according to a spokeswoman for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.  The thorough disposal process requires that the waste is disinfected  then put in a red "bio bag " disinfected  then placed in another bag  disinfected and then placed in a 55-gallon watertight drum that is sealed and contains disinfectant. Finally  the waste is incinerated.  "Although many of our members have not handled Category A waste before  but they are familiar with federal guidelines for handling the waste " said Anne Germain  director of waste and recycling technology at the National Waste & Recycling Association.  "Our members have decades of experience dealing with healthcare waste and now have the information to handle Ebola-infected materials " Germain further added.

The largest Ebola outbreak to date is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa  which is centered in Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of November 2  2014  this outbreak has 13 042 reported cases resulting in 4 818 deaths.  All medical waste must be properly handled and be responsibly disposed of  but medical waste associated with the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)  a Category A infectious disease  is especially challenging for healthcare workers and medical waste disposal companies.  The patient’s profuse sweating and excretions of other bodily fluids cause widespread contamination to virtually everything in the treatment room and the head-to-toe personal protection equipment (PPE) worn by caregivers.  Current efforts to treat an infected person include giving either oral re-hydration therapy or intravenous fluids. The disease has a high risk of death  killing between 25 percent and 90 percent of those infected with the virus  averaging out at 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss  and typically follows 6 to 16 days after symptoms appear.  The virus spreads by direct contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected human or animal. Infection may also occur by direct contact with a recently contaminated item or surface. Spread of the disease through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.  The volume of medical waste associated with the disease is staggering. According to the Los Angeles Times  a single Ebola patient in a U.S. hospital will generate eight 55-gallon barrels or 440 gallons of medical waste each day. This includes virtually all material that comes in contact with the patient  like PPE worn by caregivers  bedding  instruments and food related materials. Even furniture  curtains and mattresses must be treated as contaminated.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend autoclaving or incineration of Ebola waste to destroy the microbes; however incinerating infected waste is banned in several states and must be transported to other states for incineration.  Transporting Ebola waste by road  rail or plane is also problematic. Under federal Department of Transportation (DOT) guidelines  Ebola waste is designated as a Class A infectious substance capable of causing death or disability  and requires a special permit for transport.  “The Ebola virus itself is not particularly hardy ” CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said recently before a Congressional hearing. “It’s killed by bleach  by autoclaving  or by a variety of chemicals.”  The Healthcare Coalition for Emergency Preparedness (HCEP)  an organization with the primary mission to raise awareness on healthcare facility operational sustainability during a crisis or emergency  is concerned about preparedness issues related to Ebola.  In a mid-October letter to a U.S. House of Representatives’ oversight hearing examining America’s public health response to the Ebola outbreak  Darrell A. Henry  executive director of HCEP outlined his organization’s recommendations for handling Ebola medical waste. Following are excerpts from that letter:  “We believe that there are simple solutions that can be implemented quickly  including designated treatment centers; utilize mobile triage centers; recommend more conservative protections for healthcare workers; establish protocols for patient movement; disinfect solid and liquid waste on-site as close to the source as possible; and consider deploying mobile waste sterilizers to medical centers.  “Additionally  with healthcare workers on the front lines in the battle to contain Ebola  the need for proper personal protective equipment and infection control protocols is paramount. We know that there is not much information and research on disease transmission in the healthcare setting  including the potential for infectious particles to be suspended in the air around a symptomatic patient. Thus  it only seems appropriate to adopt more conservative measures to protect healthcare providers.  “We are pleased to note that CDC has now clarified that Ebola waste is a Category A infectious material  which the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health  safety  and property when transported in commerce  and should not be treated like normal regulated medical waste.  “In addition to performing on-site sterilization of Ebola waste before it is removed from the facility  liquid Ebola waste should be disinfected before it is put into a municipal sewer system. CDC notes that the virus can be effectively killed with autoclave sterilization and bleach solutions  stating: “Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately inactivated or incinerated is no longer infectious.”  “It is important to know that  as recent as 20 to 25 years ago  most hospitals had on-site technology (incineration) to quickly and effectively destroy any contagious waste  but that was discontinued as a result of EPA regulations to reduce toxic emissions ” Henry continued. “Today  just 20 percent of hospitals have on-site technology (autoclaves). Most institutions outsource the treatment of medical waste  trucking it through communities to a central processing center. Nearly all of the top ranked medical institutions utilize on-site sterilization technology  which is readily available and affordable.  “At Emory Medical Center  one of the Ebola patients was producing up to 40 bags of contagious waste per day. If there was an outbreak  it would be unlikely that any truck transporter would have the capability  (i.e. Haz-Mat trucks  drivers  and DOT approved containers  etc.) to safely manage this deadly material. This situation would further be complicated by insurance and regulatory challenges as hospitals are legally liable for the disinfection of any waste they produce ” Henry said.  Sol Fried  president of Cyntox Biohazards Solutions  a company based in New York City that provides nationwide disposal services of medical and biohazardous waste said the company  like most med-waste disposal companies  is not fully prepared to handle Ebola material.  “Our company is not yet certified to pick up Ebola waste products  meaning anything that has come in contact with an Ebola patient ” Fried said. “The State of New Jersey has reached out to us for special training to be certified to pick up anything that has come in contact with Ebola. That is something we are in the process of doing  which will be done over the next week or so. Our employee training should not take more than a day and will take place online.  “At the current level we are not interested in handling Ebola medical waste. I don’t know if it’s worth the money at this time. If it becomes an epidemic then it may interest us  but I don’t see it becoming that. It seems more hysteria than a real need at this time. For small amounts it’s not economically viable for us.  “Most of our customers are contracted over three and five year agreements where we are picking on a weekly or monthly basis and our profit margins are very small. You only get profits in year two or three. So for one pickup of Ebola waste we could be charging lots of money  so it really does not make sense.  “It looks like the state is going to make sure everyone’s medical waste provider is permitted to pick up Ebola waste. That’s something we may have to do because the state is requiring state facilities to contract out to an Ebola certified waste handling company.  “The liabilities for handling Ebola waste are huge as well. We’d have to contact our insurance company prior to going into such an industry and it’s probably very expensive coverage ” Fried speculated.  Training healthcare workers to properly handle Ebola related waste is another major challenge. Many hospitals and med-waste companies rely on Compliance Publishing.Com for the latest information and guidance on Ebola. Alan Rosenauer  publisher of Compliance Publishing Corporation indicated that  Compliance has been helping companies in a variety of industries by developing and maintaining on-line searchable databases of compliance information that make compliance management easier.  “We don’t train companies; rather we provide information and guidance documents which come from organizations like the CDC  DOT and WHO ” Rosenauer explained. “At the Ebola Information Center on our website we provide the latest information to help medical waste companies  hospitals and clinics understand  handle  package and transport Ebola waste properly and safely. We also e-mail the information as well as post it on our website. In fact  we just published information and guidance for transporting bulk contaminated Ebola med-waste which was sent to everyone in the industry.  “Normally we send the information to just our customers  but right now we’re sending it to every medical waste transporter to make sure everyone is fully aware.  “Training can let someone know what the standards are. What the rules on conduct are  especially with Ebola. It’s not that they are not prepared  most of them are  but they don’t know exactly what they have to do to be compliant. Up until recently there was very little guidance on who needed to do what. What are the standards for packaging? What are the standards for transportation? Do you have to get a special permit to transport? Companies may still need a special permit  it’s just that DOT has recently provided guidelines on transporting bulk Category A waste ” Rosenauer concluded.  Much of the so called “Ebola Panic” has been created by the news media and let’s hope that cooler heads prevail and this deadly disease is contained and an effective treatment is found. Now is the time for everyone in the healthcare and waste disposal industries and governments at all levels to work together and concentrate on strict procedures and protocols to prevent the spread of Ebola  including protecting our borders from carriers of this infectious disease.

Most hospitals contract with medical waste laundry services that clean soiled linens offsite. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ebola page  updated Aug. 1  has two answers:  "… discard all linens  non-fluid-impermeable pillows or mattresses  and textile privacy curtains as a regulated medical waste." "…materials should be placed in leak-proof containment and discarded as regulated medical waste. To minimize contamination of the exterior of the waste bag  place this bag in a rigid waste receptacle designed for this use. Incineration as a waste treatment process is effective in eliminating viral infectivity and provides waste minimization. However  check with your state's regulated medical waste program for more guidance and coordinate your waste management activities for the patient's isolation area with your medical waste contractor." But what should hospitals do with such materials for other patients? And what are laundry processing companies doing to assure that their workers are not infected while handling infected materials?  2. How should toilet waste from suspected Ebola patients be disposed? At Nebraska Medical Center  where Rick Sacra  MD  a Massachusetts physician infected with Ebola while working in a Liberian hospital last month  toilet wastes were treated with a disinfectant in the toilet for 10 minutes before being flushed into the sewer treatment system according to an article in the Nebraska World-Herald. The CDC  however  says human,ebola-c5edfde546768a9330228bcde0171a46a7a67cf654a547adc9b1b30590294e41,0,1587,2,2016-04-25 11:35:04.413837, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5188,Multisociety Statement on Processing Biohazardous Medical Waste      	 The recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease has raised questions about the correct handling of Ebola contaminated biohazardous medical waste. This joint advisory statement is intended to provide guidance to personnel and health care organizations for handling biohazardous medical waste  including waste contaminated with the Ebola virus.  This statement addresses the use of sterilizers for processing biohazardous waste in the health care facility. This document does not address transportation of biohazardous waste  or processing of contaminated reusable medical devices and textiles.  Recognizing that sterilization modalities other than moist heat may be used for processing biohazardous waste  the term “sterilizer” is used rather than “autoclave” as used in other guidelines.  This is an evolving issue and healthcare professionals should review current research and incorporate new evidence into practice to mitigate occupational and patient risk associated with handling biohazardous medical waste.  AAMI  AORN  APIC  AST and IAHCSMM recommend that:  Health care organizations should not circumvent established protocols for handling biohazardous medical waste. Biohazardous medical waste should not be brought into clean areas where processing reusable medical devices is performed. Biohazardous medical waste should not be inactivated in a sterilizer that is used for processing reusable medical devices. Sterilizers used to inactivate biohazardous medical waste should be designed and validated for that particular purpose. Organizations should work with infection preventionists and keep abreast of evolving professional and regulatory guidelines for handling biohazardous medical waste. ,ebola-306347d0daf3791561ecbc809ee333c4f1b306d33168d0cc957ac122c8cbbee2,0,1772,2,2016-04-25 11:36:21.047888, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5192,Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed EVD is subject to procedures set forth by local  state  and federal regulations. Basic principles for spills of blood and other potentially infectious materials are outlined in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030).  Waste contaminated (or suspected to be contaminated) with Ebola virus is a Category A infectious substance regulated as a hazardous material under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR  Parts 171-180). Requirements in the HMR apply to any material DOT determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health  safety  and property when transported in commerce1. For off-site commercial transport of Ebola-associated waste  strict compliance with the HMR is required. If a person requires a variance to the HMR  that person must apply for a Special Permit under 49 CFR Â§ 107.105. DOT may grant a special permit if the applicant can demonstrate an alternative packaging will achieve a safety level that is (1) at least equal to the safety level required under the HMR  or (2) consistent with the public interest if a required safety level does not exist. DOT has granted multiple special permits authorizing the transportation in commerce of certain Ebola-associated waste. Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately incinerated  autoclaved  or otherwise inactivated is not infectious  does not pose a health risk  and is not considered to be regulated medical waste or a hazardous material under federal law. Therefore  such waste no longer is considered a Category A infectious substance and is not subject to the requirements of the HMR. Inactivation or incineration of Ebola-associated waste within a hospital system may be subject to state  local  and OSHA regulations. On-site inactivation Ebola-associated waste may be inactivated through the use of appropriate autoclaves. Other methods of inactivation (e.g.  chemical inactivation) have not been standardized and would need to consider worker safety issues  as well as the potential for triggering other federal safety regulations. On-site incineration Ebola-associated waste may be incinerated. The products of incineration (i.e.  the ash) can be transported and disposed of in accordance with state and local regulations and standard protocols for hospital waste disposal. Ebola-associated waste disposal is subject to state and local regulations. Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately inactivated or incinerated is not infectious and is not considered to be regulated medical waste or a hazardous material under federal law.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5211,Ebola virus is transmitted through:  Direct  unprotected contact (i.e.  with broken skin  eyes  nose or mouth) with blood or other body fluids (e.g.    feces  vomit  urine  saliva  sweat  breast milk  tears  vaginal fluid  and semen) of an infected patient who is actively ill Needle stick injuries from needles and syringes that have been contaminated with infected blood or other body fluids and tissue from an infected patient who is actively ill Unprotected contact with medical equipment contaminated with blood or body fluids from an infected patient who is actively ill Direct  unprotected contact with the body of someone who has died from Ebola The World Health Organization recommends that human wastes  including waste from Ebola patients such as vomitus and feces  be either disposed of through a sanitary sewer or be buried in a pit toilet or latrine with no additional contact or treatment.4 5 6 There has been no evidence to date that Ebola can be transmitted via exposure to sewage.7 The WHO has established guidelines for hygiene and PPE to prevent exposure to potential pathogens when working with untreated sewage.4 5 In the United States  human waste (i.e.  excreta)  blood  and other potentially infectious materials are routinely released into sanitary sewers. Wastewater handling processes in the United States are designed to inactivate and remove pathogens  such as Ebola. Workers should follow the guidelines below to prevent exposure to human pathogens  including Ebola virus  when working with untreated wastewater.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)  Workers handling human waste or sewage should be provided hand washing facilities at the worksite  PPE (described below)  and training on how to use this PPE. The training should specifically address methods for the correct and safe removal of PPE to prevent workers from contaminating themselves or others during its removal. Trained workers should demonstrate both knowledge of the appropriate PPE they will be expected to wear and proficiency in its use. If using a respirator  the worker should be part of a respiratory protection program that includes medical clearance and fit-testing under OSHAâs PPE standard (29 CFR 1910.132). Workers should wash hands with soap and water immediately after removing PPE. Leak-proof infectious waste containers should be provided for discarding used PPE. Guidelines for dealing with potentially infectious waste can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/medical-waste-management.html and https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA_FS-3756.pdf  The following PPE is recommended for workers handling untreated sewage:  Goggles or face shield: to protect eyes from splashes of untreated sewage Face mask (e.g.  surgical mask): to protect nose and mouth from splashes of human waste. If undertaking cleaning processes that generate aerosols  a NIOSH-approved N-95 respirator should be used. Impermeable or fluid-resistant coveralls: to keep untreated sewage off clothing Waterproof gloves (such as heavy-duty rubber outer gloves with nitrile inner gloves) to prevent exposure of hands to untreated sewage Rubber boots: to prevent exposure of feet to untreated sewage. Basic Hygiene Practices  Wash skin with soap and water immediately after handling sewage  or any materials that have been in contact with sewage. Avoid touching face  mouth  eyes  nose  or open sores and cuts while handling sewage  or any materials that have been in contact with sewage. Wash hands with soap and water before eating or drinking after handling sewage. Remove soiled work clothes and do not take home to launder. Launder clothing at work or use a uniform service. Eat in designated areas away from untreated sewage. Do not smoke or chew tobacco or gum while handling human waste or sewage  or any materials that have been in contact with human waste or sewage. Cover open sores  cuts  and wounds with clean  dry bandages. References  ,ebola-008c044f564afa636e57f49d63cff85159554ba089f078fc77945c049d2d4099,0,3942,2,2016-04-25 11:47:05.220797, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5216,While the Ebola virus itself is not particularly hardy and can easily be killed by household disinfectant  bleach  heat  sunlight  alcohol and  autoclaving - the technical term for what is sometimes called steam sterilisation  it becomes an enormous tasks to kill it on everything it had touched.   Caring for Ebola patients produces a mountain of potentially contaminated material. The disease causes substantial sweating  bleeding and vomiting and the virus can  via these bodily fluids  easily be transferred to medical equipment as well as protective gear worn by medical personnel.   The Los Angeles Times and others have reported that one Ebola patient treated in a US hospital would generate eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste per day.  As Ebola can be spread through direct contact with surfaces or equipment  including bed linen  which have been contaminated with infected body fluids  these must all be sterilised or destroyed after use.  Surprisingly  according to the World Health Organisation (WHO)  Ebola waste can be effectively disposed of using standard procedures for medical waste: the virus is not thought to be particularly hardy and can be eliminated relatively easily with heat  alcohol-based products and bleach.  However  because the virus is so highly virulent  and because its persistence in the environment outside the human body has not been extensively studied  many authorities – such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States – consider that only high-temperature destruction of waste  preferably by incineration  is acceptable.  But not all hospitals  even in first world contexts  are equipped with appropriate incineration facilities  which may require transporting waste to the few that do.  Strict PPE and training needed to handle Ebola waste  The same personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by medical personnel caring for Ebola patients is required for people handling waste materials and cleaning hospital rooms: at a minimum  disposable gloves  a fluid-resistant gown  eye protection (preferably goggles) to prevent splashes  a face mask and closed impermeable shoes – to protect against viral contaminants as well as contact with the disinfectants used.  Waste disposal personnel also go through rigorous training to prepare them for their task.  Sharp  hard objects like needles and tubing that has been in contact with body fluids should be placed inside puncture-resistant waste containers.  Solid  non-sharp  infectious waste must be placed in leak-proof waste bags and covered bins. Bins should never be carried against the body  for example on the shoulder.  Ebola waste should be incinerated – but can also be buried  Destroying medical waste in an industry-standard incinerator is the preferred end-point according to the CDC. Waste may also be rendered harmless in an autoclave  - a chamber that subjects the waste to steam at high pressure and temperature.  However  in settings where safe complete incineration may not be available  the WHO recommends burying waste.  Solid waste should be placed in a pit 2 metres deep and filled to a depth of 1-1.5 m. After each wasteload  the waste is covered with a layer of soil 10-15 cm deep. The area designated for the final treatment and disposal of waste should have controlled access to prevent entry by animals  untrained personnel or children.  The WHO states that waste such as faeces  urine and vomit  and liquid waste from washing  can be disposed of in the sewerage system or even a pit latrine  with no further treatment necessary.  All surfaces of the hospital room housing an Ebola patient must be carefully cleaned  at least once a day.  The Ebola virus  while being highly infectious  is not believed to be particularly persistent in the environment outside the body. Thus it is easily destroyed by many standard disinfectants (including bleach). However  given Ebola’s virulence  the CDC recommends cleaning with disinfectants usually used to kill “tougher” viruses like polio and flu.  Surprisingly  the WHO states that bed linen used by Ebola patients can be,ebola-c2e3799889f9227123d7ee568ec200f1ca78ea5520858704687dea484ec1d113,0,4114,2,2016-04-25 11:50:16.589361, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5219,A number of things came up that surprised us and that we felt really needed to be shared with our colleagues ” he says.  The first of those was the sheer volume of waste generated by each Ebola patient. The group calculated that each patient treated at the Nebraska facility created about 1 010 pounds of solid waste  most of it in the form of personal protective equipment (PPE) — the hoods  face shields  suits and foot covers that doctors and nurses wear. That equipment  as well as towels and linens used for bedding  created around four to eight large bags of waste a day.  Lowe says that the group decided to treat liquid waste generated by the patients even more stringently than required by the CDC. “The lion’s share of calls we took from groups both within our facility and from outside the facility were concerns about exactly what we were doing with all that liquid waste ” he says.  CDC guidelines say that normal waste treatment chemicals in toilets are sufficient to kill Ebola. But the unit’s director Philip Smith and Lowe had two concerns. In the event that the toilets backed up  potentially infectious material could flood into the patient rooms and possibly into other pipes in the hospital as well. Public health groups also wanted assurances that the waste would not be contaminating facilities outside of the hospital. So Smith decided to take extra measures by treating the toilets in the patient’s room with hospital-grade disinfectant. Normally it takes four minutes to sterilize the waste  but to be safe  all Ebola patients’ waste was held in this sterilizing solution for 2.5 times the recommended time before it was flushed.  Flushing  says Smith  is preferable to storing the waste in a separate container and then autoclaving the contents. “You could end up having containers full of liquid that are difficult and hazardous to work with ” he says.  The bags of solid waste  meanwhile  were tied and taped closed  then doused with bleach and handled in very strict ways by workers in full PPE. The Nebraska biocontainment unit is intentionally designed to have its own decontaminating autoclave inside the unit  so soiled waste does not have to be removed from the premises. While Ebola-related waste requires special sterilization and decontamination procedures  it can be turned into normal medical waste that can be disposed of in the hopsital’s normal ways.  MORE: 12 Answers to Ebola’s Hard Questions  To do that  health care workers send the bags into a sterilizing room. Each bag is handled at arm’s length so the workers don’t get contaminated by virus that may be on the bag and so that workers who may have virus on their PPE don’t contaminate the bags further. The bags are then treated with high temperatures and sterilizing chemicals. Once decontaminated  the bags are placed into another bag and into a watertight container and marked as biohazardous material. In this state  the waste can be disposed of as any other hospital waste in the proper medical waste removal sites.  So far  those strategies are working. Two Ebola patients  Ashoka Mukpo and Dr. Richard Sacra  were treated there and recovered  and no health care workers were infected with the virus.  ,ebola-8215d9a7fa3f20828cafef8f84f2d2df13db8b79c3d2ccd4cb55eafc97c505cb,0,3209,2,2016-04-25 11:54:01.451915, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5222,Background  The Ebola virus is an âenveloped virusâ; meaning  the core of the virus is surrounded by a lipoprotein outer layer. Enveloped viruses such as Ebola are more susceptible to destruction with a number of physical and chemical agents than viruses without lipoprotein envelopes (Figure 1). Â   For the purposes of this document  any waste generated in the care of patients with known or suspected Ebola is considered a Category A infectious substance.  Physical Agents/Heat  Physical agents that can eradicate Ebola virus include heat  sunlight  ultraviolet light  E-Beam  and Gamma Rays.1 Â   Killing Ebola virus on materials it is suspected to be on or attached to can done by heating:  To 60Â°C (140Â°F) for 60 minutes; To 72-80Â°C (162Â° - 176Â°F) for 30 minutes; or Submersing the material in boiling water for five minutes.2 This can be achieved by submitting materials suspected of being contaminated with Ebola to treatment in an autoclave under a âvalidated waste cycleâ to 121Â°C (250Â°F) for at least 30 minutes depending on the load and packaging  which is more than enough heat and time to kill the virus. Autoclave runs should include a process control to show that the cycle was performed effectively. The Autoclave cycles should be checked at some frequency with biological indicator (spores) as a quality assurance measure to show that the waste cycles is achieving desired results.  Other heat treatments include incineration. Incinerators run at extremely high temperatures  well above the relatively low temperatures needed to kill Ebola virus. Incineration would be the best method for large or bulky items  such as mattresses. Incineration that reduces waste to ash at any temperature kills Ebola virus.3 The ash produced via incineration is NOT hazardous with respect to microbial pathogens.  Chemical Agents  Ebola virus can also be killed by many common chemical agents. Chemical agents that will kill the virus include bleach  detergents  solvents  alcohols  ammonia  aldehydes  halogens  peracetic acid  peroxides  phenolics  and quaternary ammonium compounds.4  Ebola virus can be killed with hospital-grade disinfectants (such as household bleach) when used according to the label instructions. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-registered hospital disinfectant with a label claim for a non-enveloped virus (e.g.  norovirus  rotavirus  adenovirus  poliovirus) can be used to disinfect environmental surfaces in rooms of patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus infection. Please see EPAâs Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virus.  Additional Information  There is limited evidence of Ebola virus transmission through the environment or an inanimate object that may be contaminated during patient care with infectious organisms and serve in their transmission (e.g.  bed rails  door knobs  laundry).5 Ebola virus has not been found on surfaces in the absence of visible blood in the patient care environment.6 Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis to help reduce the risk of contact with contaminated surfaces. In addition  spills of biological fluids should be immediately cleaned and disinfected. Disinfectants should also be added to the bagged waste.  â Figure 1.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5235,Due to conflicting regulations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Transportation on how to dispose of waste materials from patients being treated for the Ebola virus  some waste management companies will not remove medical materials used to treat those patients.  This conflict in disposal mandates could not only prevent hospitals from successfully treating patients that show symptoms of Ebola  but also put the hospital's surrounding communities at risk.  Because of federal transportation guidelines that require these items to be taken away by people with special hazardous materials training  Reuters reported Sept. 24 that Stericycle  the waste management company for Atlanta's Emory University Hospital  would not initially handle the waste generated in treating the Ebola-infected patients. Emory was the first hospital to care for Ebola patients in the U.S. during the current outbreak.  The hospital had 40 bags of hazardous waste at the peak of its treatment of the Ebola-infected patients  according to Emory's Dr. Aneesh Mehta. At one point  the staff had to buy as many 32-gallon containers with lids as possible from Home Depot to contain the waste until Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention helped Emory make a deal with Stericycle.  The number of people infected with Ebola in the West African countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone could reach anywhere from 550 000 to 1.4 million by mid-January  the CDC recently reported. Four Americans since August have been flown from West Africa to the U.S. where they were treated for Ebola. With the Ebola outbreak continuing to spread in Africa  it is likely that more infected patients will be diagnosed in U.S. hospitals  experts say. As many as 10 patients have been tested in U.S. hospitals for showing possible signs of an Ebola infection.  The CDC and the U.S. Department of Transportation  which regulates the transportation of infectious waste  have different guidelines for removing Ebola waste.  The CDC tells hospitals to discard Ebola waste as they would other waste considered "regulated medical waste " while the DOT requires that Ebola waste be put in special packaging and removed by those with special training  according to Reuters. Since there may not be packaging approved for handling Ebola waste  many waste management companies don't think they are legally allowed to transport the waste  which is why hospitals may be having difficulty with its removal.  Emory has been able to sterilize the waste with one of the university's autoclaves before letting a waste management company take it away  but not every hospital has access to one of these machines on-site. "For this reason  it would be very difficult for a hospital to agree to care for Ebola cases - this desperately needs a fix " Dr. Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Public Health Committee  told Reuters.  ,ebola-58428a420e8f57e21650d31946d406492cdf981805b0c74f9fbf3543e4648362,0,2950,2,2016-04-25 12:43:27.625271,

(Photo: AP) Washington: The United States is days away from settling the critical question of how hospitals should handle and dispose of medical waste from Ebola patients  a government official said on Wednesday.  Experts have warned that conflicting U.S. regulations over how such waste should be transported could make it very difficult for U.S. hospitals to safely care for patients with Ebola  a messy disease that causes diarrhea  vomiting and in some cases  bleeding from the eyes and ears.  Safely handling such waste presents a dual challenge for regulators  who want to both prevent the accidental spread of the deadly disease and avert any deliberate attempts to use it as a bioweapon.  Most U.S. hospitals are not equipped with incinerators or large sterilizers called autoclaves that could accommodate the large amounts of soiled linens  contaminated syringes and virus-spattered protective gear generated from the care of an Ebola patient  said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Public Health Committee.  Sterilizing Ebola waste before it is transported is important not only to protect waste haulers but to guard against someone using the waste "for nefarious purposes " said Sean Kaufman  ‎president of Behavioral-Based Improvement Solutions  an Atlanta-based biosafety firm. "It's not just a safety issue " he said.  The matter  which was first reported by Reuters last month  may pose a significant challenge for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas  which is now treating the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed on U.S. soil.  Duchin said he is not aware of whether the hospital has its own incinerator or large autoclave  but if it does not  "they are going to have to find a temporary solution for managing infectious waste. That puts the hospital in a very difficult situation."  Cynthia Quarterman  administrator of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration  which oversees dangerous shipments  said her agency is "working on how we can clarify even further for hospitals  for the public  what the appropriate transportation should be."  ,ebola-fe004c2cb2374883831a3b5095cc4692588519863323fd27a59908345f59b9fc,3,2386,2,2016-04-25 13:09:16.515961, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,258,containment of ebola medical waste,5291,Officials at the University of Nebraska  which treated Ebola patients  issues a case study in how to get rid of Ebola waste  When treating Ebola patients  hospitals have more than their patients and workers to protect. It’s their responsibility to properly dispose of anything involved in caring for the patients that might be contaminated—and that includes liquid waste  protective equipment  anything used in the lab  linens  towels  pillows  mattresses and even the curtains used in the patient’s room.  In the latest issue of the American Journal of Infection Control  John Lowe  associate director of research from the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit at the Nebraska Medical Center  describes how the team there disposed of waste generated while two patients recovered from their infections there. Some of the procedures in place  Lowe says  go beyond the guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The report will undoubtedly be studied by the 35 hospitals that the CDC designated on Dec. 2 as Ebola treatment centers across the nation.  “A number of things came up that surprised us and that we felt really needed to be shared with our colleagues ” he says.  The first of those was the sheer volume of waste generated by each Ebola patient. The group calculated that each patient treated at the Nebraska facility created about 1 010 pounds of solid waste  most of it in the form of personal protective equipment (PPE) — the hoods  face shields  suits and foot covers that doctors and nurses wear. That equipment  as well as towels and linens used for bedding  created around four to eight large bags of waste a day.  Lowe says that the group decided to treat liquid waste generated by the patients even more stringently than required by the CDC. “The lion’s share of calls we took from groups both within our facility and from outside the facility were concerns about exactly what we were doing with all that liquid waste ” he says.  CDC guidelines say that normal waste treatment chemicals in toilets are sufficient to kill Ebola. But the unit’s director Philip Smith and Lowe had two concerns. In the event that the toilets backed up  potentially infectious material could flood into the patient rooms and possibly into other pipes in the hospital as well. Public health groups also wanted assurances that the waste would not be contaminating facilities outside of the hospital. So Smith decided to take extra measures by treating the toilets in the patient’s room with hospital-grade disinfectant. Normally it takes four minutes to sterilize the waste  but to be safe  all Ebola patients’ waste was held in this sterilizing solution for 2.5 times the recommended time before it was flushed.  Flushing  says Smith  is preferable to storing the waste in a separate container and then autoclaving the contents. “You could end up having containers full of liquid that are difficult and hazardous to work with ” he says.  The bags of solid waste  meanwhile  were tied and taped closed  then doused with bleach and handled in very strict ways by workers in full PPE. The Nebraska biocontainment unit is intentionally designed to have its own decontaminating autoclave inside the unit  so soiled waste does not have to be removed from the premises. While Ebola-related waste requires special sterilization and decontamination procedures  it can be turned into normal medical waste that can be disposed of in the hopsital’s normal ways.  ,ebola-5b7ad0559b1dd4d9211ea387d77826f95800261ed97c94872920f900b645efd1,0,3466,2,2016-04-25 13:10:18.558976,

By Julie Steenhuysen Reuters 7:29 a.m. CDT  September 24  2014  U.S. hospitals may be unprepared to safely dispose of the infectious waste generated by any Ebola virus disease patient to arrive unannounced in the country  potentially putting the wider community at risk  biosafety experts said.  Waste management companies are refusing to haul away the soiled sheets and virus-spattered protective gear associated with treating the disease  citing federal guidelines that require Ebola-related waste to be handled in special packaging by people with hazardous materials training  infectious disease and biosafety experts told Reuters.  Many U.S. hospitals are unaware of the regulatory snafu  which experts say could threaten their ability to treat any person who develops Ebola in the U.S. after coming from an infected region. It can take as long as 21 days to develop Ebola symptoms after exposure.  Related CDC: Ebola Cases Could Reach 1.4 Million VIDEO:  CDC: Ebola Cases Could Reach 1.4 Million Ebola death toll passes 2 800 but 'contained' in Senegal  Nigeria: WHO STORY:  Ebola death toll passes 2 800 but 'contained' in Senegal  Nigeria: WHO The issue created problems for Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  the first institution to care for Ebola patients here. As Emory was treating two U.S. missionaries who were evacuated from West Africa in August  their waste hauler  Stericycle  initially refused to handle it. Stericycle declined comment.  Ebola symptoms can include copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhoea  and nurses and doctors at Emory donned full hazmat suits to protect themselves. Bags of waste quickly began to pile up.  "At its peak  we were up to 40 bags a day of medical waste  which took a huge tax on our waste management system " Emory's Dr. Aneesh Mehta told colleagues at a medical meeting earlier this month.  Emory sent staff to Home Depot to buy as many 32-gallon rubber waste containers with lids that they could get their hands on. Emory kept the waste in a special containment area for six days until its Atlanta neighbor  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  helped broker an agreement with Stericycle.  While U.S. hospitals may be prepared clinically to care for a patient with Ebola  Emory's experience shows that logistically they are far from ready  biosafety experts said.  "Our waste management obstacles and the logistics we had to put in place were amazing " Patricia Olinger  director of environmental health and safety at Emory  said in an interview.  NOT IF  BUT WHEN  The worst Ebola outbreak on record is now projected to infect as many as 20 000 people in West Africa by November  while U.S. officials have said that number could rise above 550 000 by mid-January without an international intervention to contain its spread. Experts say it is only a matter of time before at least some infected patients are diagnosed in U.S. hospitals  most likely walking into the emergency department seeking treatment.  Already there have been several scares. As of Sept. 8  as many as 10 patients have been tested by U.S. hospitals for suspected Ebola cases  Dr. Barbara Knust  team leader for the CDC's Ebola response  said at a medical meeting this month. All tested negative.  The CDC has issued detailed guidelines on how hospitals can care for such patients  but their recommendations for handling Ebola waste differs from the U.S. Department of Transportation  which regulates the transportation of infectious waste.  CDC advises hospitals to place Ebola-infected items in leak-proof containers and discard them as they would other biohazards that fall into the category of "regulated medical waste." According to DOT guidelines  items in this category can't be in a form that can cause human harm. The DOT classifies Ebola as a Category A agent  or one that is potentially life-threatening.  DOT regulations say transporting Category A items requires special packaging and hazmat training.  CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency isn't aware of any packaging that is approved for handling Ebola waste.  As a result  conventional waste management contractors believe they can't legally haul Ebola waste  said Thomas Metzger  communication director for the National Waste & Recycling Association trade group.  A TEMPORARY FIX  Part of Emory's solution was to bring in one of the university's large-capacity sterilizers called an autoclave  which uses pressurized steam to neutralize infectious agents  before handing the waste off to its disposal contractor for incineration.  Few hospitals have the ability to autoclave medical waste from Ebola patients on site.  "For this reason  it would be very difficult for a hospital to agree to care for Ebola cases - this desperately needs a fix " said Dr Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Public Health Committee.  Dr. Gavin Macgregor-Skinner  an expert on public health preparedness at Pennsylvania State University  said there's "no way in the world" that U.S. hospitals are ready to treat patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola.  "Where they come undone every time is the management of their liquid and solid waste " said Macgregor-Skinner  who recently trained healthcare workers in Nigeria on behalf of the Elizabeth R. Griffin Research Foundation.  Skinner said the CDC is working with DOT to resolve the issue. He said the CDC views its disposal guidelines as appropriate  and that they have been proven to prevent infection in the handling of waste from HIV  hepatitis  and tuberculosis patients.  Joe Delcambre  a spokesman for DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  could not say whether requiring hospitals to first sterilize Ebola waste would resolve the issue for waste haulers. He did confirm that DOT is meeting with CDC.  Metzger said his members are also meeting with officials from the DOT  the CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency to sort out the issue.  ,ebola-063b3c2e0fb2ade0f07ecb0893366ac44c0ab63b210f4b3df995b5868e38c56b,0,6041,2,2016-04-25 14:21:10.573011,

(AP) _ Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster is seeking to block a sterilization company from handling any medical waste contaminated with Ebola at its St. Louis facility.  Koster said Friday he has asked a St. Louis Circuit judge to grant a temporary restraining order against Stericycle Inc. He says treating waste potentially infected with Ebola poses a threat to workers at the facility.  Calls from The Associated Press to Stericycle were not immediately returned Friday.  Stericycle received a federal permit earlier this month to remove waste from the Texas hospital and home where a man with Ebola virus stayed before dying.  Koster’s court filing also alleges that the St. Louis Stericycle violated the waste management law in the past by failing to properly test and operate its equipment or track infectious materials.  ,ebola-54a959d78d155cc93d59d05d197b0ca1371bbbe8ceba85b5bcafbce75fd30c5e,0,852,2,2016-04-25 14:33:59.850244,

Contaminated items from the patient and medical team are put into the autoclave on one side shown here  get sterilized  and are removed on the other side.  An Omaha company  Primus Sterilizer  made the autoclave â a high-pressure steam sterilizer â for the Nebraska Medical Centerâs biocontainment unit.  Installing an autoclave âturned out to be an amazing decision â the unitâs medical director said.  âWe thought we might encounter diseases where the environment would be a major concern â said Dr. Phil Smith  who pushed to get the unit built in 2004. âThe guidelines at that time said for Ebola and smallpox  you should autoclave everything that goes out of a containment area.â  The other decision made by leaders at the time was to have it be a pass-through autoclave  âwhich turned out to be very handy â Smith said. Contaminated protective gear  bedsheets and the patientâs clothing go in one side  get sterilized and are pulled out the other side to be hauled away to be incinerated.  The machine was designed by Primus founder Ron Thompson and is like those sold for more than 25 years. It is 20 inches by 20 inches by 38 inches â less than half the size of a normal refrigerator. Itâs one of more than 20 different sizes made at the companyâs manufacturing site in Great Bend  Kansas  said CEO Michael Douglas. The companyâs headquarters are at 6565 S. 118th St. in Omaha.  Primusâ largest autoclave is 308 cubic feet â big enough to hold an automobile.  Surgical instruments also are cleaned in autoclaves  and laboratories use autoclaves to sterilize equipment.  Primus has gotten calls from international clients about how the autoclave worked for treating the Ebola patients who came to Omaha  said Connie Mansfield  marketing and communications manager.  âWeâre seeing some interest because of that situation  because they did such a good job of treating both patients  and there were no problems with the staff â Mansfield said.  The large amount of contaminated material and waste generated by Ebola patients is an issue that medical facilities will have to deal with  she said.  Nebraska Med Center officials said the time it takes to autoclave all the waste â one load takes about 30 minutes â is one of the reasons for limiting the number of Ebola patients that can be treated at one time.  The gear  clothing  etc.  that needed to be autoclaved during the treatment of the unitâs first Ebola patient  Dr. Rick Sacra  weighed more than 1 011 pounds after it was treated. For the second patient  Ashoka Mukpo  the treated waste weighed more than 1 806 pounds.  Even though Mukpo was treated for about 17 days versus the 21 needed for Sacra  more potentially contaminated gear was generated  partly because lab technicians worked in a lab set up inside the unit after Sacraâs departure.  If the biocontainment unit didnât have an autoclave  its Ebola-related waste would be treated as a Category A infectious substance  said Thom Metzger of the National Waste & Recycling Association. That would mean much more packaging and stricter handling â including hauling to a special out-of-state site.,ebola-07fe8a4ae3908a0c0bd0eff74e57468109ff6071c8194d37c93fb0f2998d0f09,0,3279,2,2016-04-28 14:40:14.634135, 
1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,259,cost of ebola medical waste,5179,(RMW) associated with Ebola because of its highly infectious nature  the unprecedented volume of waste generated by this disease and the prospect of it spreading to pandemic proportions if not strictly contained.  After contacting several hazardous waste handling businesses  some declined to comment on this sensitive issue.  Stericycle  one of the largest hazardous waste handling companies in the U.S.  and the one that handled the Ebola medical waste from the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where 42 year old Thomas Eric Duncan died from Ebola on October 8  provided the following statement:  “It is Stericycle’s policy not to comment on the delivery of services for specific customers. However  we continue to work closely with our customers as well as federal  state and local agencies to address each potential and new Ebola case. While Stericycle has received national approval to transport Ebola-contaminated wastes  each incident is being handled on a case-by-case basis with extreme emphasis placed on protecting the general public  healthcare workers and our team members ” said Selin Hoboy  Stericycle’s vice president of legislative and regulatory affairs.  The largest Ebola outbreak to date is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa  which is centered in Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of November 2  2014  this outbreak has 13 042 reported cases resulting in 4 818 deaths.  All medical waste must be properly handled and be responsibly disposed of  but medical waste associated with the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)  a Category A infectious disease  is especially challenging for healthcare workers and medical waste disposal companies.  The patient’s profuse sweating and excretions of other bodily fluids cause widespread contamination to virtually everything in the treatment room and the head-to-toe personal protection equipment (PPE) worn by caregivers.  Current efforts to treat an infected person include giving either oral re-hydration therapy or intravenous fluids. The disease has a high risk of death  killing between 25 percent and 90 percent of those infected with the virus  averaging out at 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss  and typically follows 6 to 16 days after symptoms appear.  The virus spreads by direct contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected human or animal. Infection may also occur by direct contact with a recently contaminated item or surface. Spread of the disease through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.  The volume of medical waste associated with the disease is staggering. According to the Los Angeles Times  a single Ebola patient in a U.S. hospital will generate eight 55-gallon barrels or 440 gallons of medical waste each day. This includes virtually all material that comes in contact with the patient  like PPE worn by caregivers  bedding  instruments and food related materials. Even furniture  curtains and mattresses must be treated as contaminated.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend autoclaving or incineration of Ebola waste to destroy the microbes; however incinerating infected waste is banned in several states and must be transported to other states for incineration.  Transporting Ebola waste by road  rail or plane is also problematic. Under federal Department of Transportation (DOT) guidelines  Ebola waste is designated as a Class A infectious substance capable of causing death or disability  and requires a special permit for transport.  “The Ebola virus itself is not particularly hardy ” CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said recently before a Congressional hearing. “It’s killed by bleach  by autoclaving  or by a variety of chemicals.”  The Healthcare Coalition for Emergency Preparedness (HCEP)  an organization with the primary mission to raise awareness on healthcare facility operational sustainability during a crisis or emergency  is concerned about preparedness issues related to Ebola.  In a mid-October letter to a U.S. House of Representatives’ oversight hearing examining America’s public health response to the Ebola outbreak  Darrell A. Henry  executive director of HCEP outlined his organization’s recommendations for handling Ebola medical waste. Following are excerpts from that letter:  “We believe that there are simple solutions that can be implemented quickly  including designated treatment centers; utilize mobile triage centers; recommend more conservative protections for healthcare workers; establish protocols for patient movement; disinfect solid and liquid waste on-site as close to the source as possible; and consider deploying mobile waste sterilizers to medical centers.  “Additionally  with healthcare workers on the front lines in the battle to contain Ebola  the need for proper personal protective equipment and infection control protocols is paramount. We know that there is not much information and research on disease transmission in the healthcare setting  including the potential for infectious particles to be suspended in the air around a symptomatic patient. Thus  it only seems appropriate to adopt more conservative measures to protect healthcare providers.  “We are pleased to note that CDC has now clarified that Ebola waste is a Category A infectious material  which the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health  safety  and property when transported in commerce  and should not be treated like normal regulated medical waste.  “In addition to performing on-site sterilization of Ebola waste before it is removed from the facility  liquid Ebola waste should be disinfected before it is put into a municipal sewer system. CDC notes that the virus can be effectively killed with autoclave sterilization and bleach solutions  stating: “Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately inactivated or incinerated is no longer infectious.”  “It is important to know that  as recent as 20 to 25 years ago  most hospitals had on-site technology (incineration) to quickly and effectively destroy any contagious waste  but that was discontinued as a result of EPA regulations to reduce toxic emissions ” Henry continued. “Today  just 20 percent of hospitals have on-site technology (autoclaves). Most institutions outsource the treatment of medical waste  trucking it through communities to a central processing center. Nearly all of the top ranked medical institutions utilize on-site sterilization technology  which is readily available and affordable.  “At Emory Medical Center  one of the Ebola patients was producing up to 40 bags of contagious waste per day. If there was an outbreak  it would be unlikely that any truck transporter would have the capability  (i.e. Haz-Mat trucks  drivers  and DOT approved containers  etc.) to safely manage this deadly material. This situation would further be complicated by insurance and regulatory challenges as hospitals are legally liable for the disinfection of any waste they produce ” Henry said.  Sol Fried  president of Cyntox Biohazards Solutions  a company based in New York City that provides nationwide disposal services of medical and biohazardous waste said the company  like most med-waste disposal companies  is not fully prepared to handle Ebola material.  “Our company is not yet certified to pick up Ebola waste products  meaning anything that has come in contact with an Ebola patient ” Fried said. “The State of New Jersey has reached out to us for special training to be certified to pick up anything that has come in contact with Ebola. That is something we are in the process of doing  which will be done over the next week or so. Our employee training should not take more than a day and will take place online.  “At the current level we are not interested in handling Ebola medical waste. I don’t know if it’s worth the money at this time. If it becomes an epidemic then it may interest us  but I don’t see it becoming that. It seems more hysteria than a real need at this time. For small amounts it’s not economically viable for us.  “Most of our customers are contracted over three and five year agreements where we are picking on a weekly or monthly basis and our profit margins are very small. You only get profits in year two or three. So for one pickup of Ebola waste we could be charging lots of money  so it really does not make sense.  “It looks like the state is going to make sure everyone’s medical waste provider is permitted to pick up Ebola waste. That’s something we may have to do because the state is requiring state facilities to contract out to an Ebola certified waste handling company.  “The liabilities for handling Ebola waste are huge as well. We’d have to contact our insurance company prior to going into such an industry and it’s probably very expensive coverage ” Fried speculated.  Training healthcare workers to properly handle Ebola related waste is another major challenge. Many hospitals and med-waste companies rely on Compliance Publishing.Com for the latest information and guidance on Ebola. Alan Rosenauer  publisher of Compliance Publishing Corporation indicated that  Compliance has been helping companies in a variety of industries by developing and maintaining on-line searchable databases of compliance information that make compliance management easier.  “We don’t train companies; rather we provide information and guidance documents which come from organizations like the CDC  DOT and WHO ” Rosenauer explained. “At the Ebola Information Center on our website we provide the latest information to help medical waste companies  hospitals and clinics understand  handle  package and transport Ebola waste properly and safely. We also e-mail the information as well as post it on our website. In fact  we just published information and guidance for transporting bulk contaminated Ebola med-waste which was sent to everyone in the industry.  “Normally we send the information to just our customers  but right now we’re sending it to every medical waste transporter to make sure everyone is fully aware.  “Training can let someone know what the standards are. What the rules on conduct are  especially with Ebola. It’s not that they are not prepared  most of them are  but they don’t know exactly what they have to do to be compliant. Up until recently there was very little guidance on who needed to do what. What are the standards for packaging? What are the standards for transportation? Do you have to get a special permit to transport? Companies may still need a special permit  it’s just that DOT has recently provided guidelines on transporting bulk Category A waste ” Rosenauer concluded.  Much of the so called “Ebola Panic” has been created by the news media and let’s hope that cooler heads prevail and this deadly disease is contained and an effective treatment is found. Now is the time for everyone in the healthcare and waste disposal industries and governments at all levels to work together and concentrate on strict procedures and protocols to prevent the spread of Ebola  including protecting our borders from carriers of this infectious disease.

1,Ebola,3,assr3,417,Ebola medical waste,259,cost of ebola medical waste,5183,Key Points  The safe handling and in-hospital management of waste generated through the care of patients with Ebola is based on three main principles.  Safe containment and packaging of waste should be performed as close as possible to the point of generation. Staff should avoid opening containers to manipulate the waste after primary containment. Limit the number of personnel entering the Ebola patient care area and those handling generated waste before and after primary containment. Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedures for handling waste until onsite inactivation or transport away from the hospital for offsite inactivation. Preparing a Waste Management Plan as Part of Ebola Patient Care  Comply with your State and local regulations for handling  storage  treatment  and disposal of Ebola-associated waste. Determine whether Ebola-associated waste will be inactivated onsite at the hospital or transported offsite for inactivation. Identify a dedicated waste management team with specific training on standardized procedures for waste handling  including wearing appropriate PPE  and protocols for safely bagging and packaging waste  storing waste  and transporting packaged waste. Onsite inactivation: Ebola-associated waste may be inactivated through incineration or by autoclaving using properly maintained equipment with appropriate biological indicators. Offsite inactivation: Comply with regulations for packaging  transport and disposal of Ebola-associated waste. When selecting emergency department triage areas for the evaluation of patients with possible Ebola  a designated area should be identified for waste storage pending a determination of whether the patient has Ebola or not. The storage space should meet all applicable fire codes and principles of maintaining a clutter-free  safe environment. Waste bags should never be over-filled. Bags should be closed when two thirds full. If stored within the patient room  all filled solid waste bags and sharps containers should undergo primary closure procedures as outlined below. If stored outside the patient room  all filled solid waste bags and sharps containers should undergo both primary and secondary closure  and be removed as outlined below. Be sure healthcare personnel and environmental services staff handling waste are trained to wear recommended PPE (same used for patient care) and follow appropriate putting on and taking off procedures. Use the OSHA PPE Selection Matrix for Occupational Exposure to Ebola Virus [PDF - 3 pages] to guide selection of appropriate PPE for environmental services and waste collection workers handling  transporting  and disposing of waste. Handling and primary packaging of waste should occur in the patient room and the area where PPE is removed and be performed by the primary healthcare workers (i.e.  doctors and nurses) wearing PPE as designated in the guidance for hospitals. Supplies for Hand Hygiene  Cleaning and Disinfection  and Packaging Waste  Leak-proof labeled biohazard bags: The film bags must have a minimum film thickness of 1.5 mils (0.0015 inch) and be 175 liters or smaller (46 gallons). Reference U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) HMR requirements Approved sharps waste container Waste container in patientâs room Transport cart Absorbent disposable towels EPA-registered hospital disinfectant for use against the Ebola virus Select a hospital grade disinfectant available as wipe  spray  pull-top  or refill bottles (depending on application) with a label claim for one of the non-enveloped viruses (e.g.  norovirus  rotavirus  adenovirus  poliovirus) to disinfect hospital environmental surfaces. Disposable cleaning cloths Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) that is at least 60% alcohol Rigid outer receptacle that conforms to U.S. DOT HMR requirements for transport of Category A DOT waste provided by approved waste vendor Note: Outer package must be either a rigid United Nations Standard- or DOT-approved non-bulk packaging.

Since the first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil is being cared for at a hospital in Dallas  the issue is no longer academic.  Most American hospitals don’t contain incinerators or large autoclaves (oven-like devices) capable of decontaminating the large amount of soiled linens and other waste associated with Ebola patients  said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s Public Health Committee.  Duchin told Reuters he doesn’t know if Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas has its own incinerator or large autoclave  but if it doesn’t  “they are going to have to find a temporary solution for managing infectious waste. That puts the hospital in a very difficult situation.”  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week  Texas Health Presbyterian didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The hospital says on its website that it has an autoclave for disinfecting surgical equipment  but it’s not clear if that could be used to treat medical waste. It doesn’t appear to have an incinerator—the hospital says it ships waste off-site for incineration.  Properly sterilizing Ebola medical waste before shipping it to a center that does have an incinerator or an autoclave is important for safety but also to prevent the material from being used for nefarious purposes  experts say.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises hospitals to put such waste into leak-proof containers and have it shipped as a type of material known as “regulated medical waste.” But the federal Department of Transportation “deems Ebola a Category A infectious agent  meaning it is capable of killing people and animals  and not ‘regulated medical waste ’ a category in which pathogens are not capable of causing harm ” Reuters said.  A decision to clear up this inconsistency is expected within days.  Thomas Ksiazek  a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston who has done extensive research on Ebola  says he doesn’t see the big deal.  Ebola medical waste “can be readily taken care of with most disinfectants  without a doubt ” says Ksiazek  who used to be the head of the CDC’s Special Pathogens Branch and dealt with the containment of viruses like Ebola on a daily basis. Shipping waste in sealed containers  as with other medical waste for incineration or disinfection in an autoclave  shouldn’t pose a safety risk at all  he tells Newsweek.  He also notes that fears about Ebola spreading are overblown because it is easy to contain by isolating patients and using established sterile techniques. “I am not concerned at all” about Ebola spreading in the United States  Ksiazek says.   ,ebola-16247a95a0a2fcfeb248bafa15826c0fefa77685092d6db7e681e1ddb88ebdb2,0,2879,2,2016-04-25 11:39:51.886827,

After contacting several hazardous waste handling businesses  some declined to comment on this sensitive issue.  Stericycle  one of the largest hazardous waste handling companies in the U.S.  and the one that handled the Ebola medical waste from the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where 42 year old Thomas Eric Duncan died from Ebola on October 8  provided the following statement:  “It is Stericycle’s policy not to comment on the delivery of services for specific customers. However  we continue to work closely with our customers as well as federal  state and local agencies to address each potential and new Ebola case. While Stericycle has received national approval to transport Ebola-contaminated wastes  each incident is being handled on a case-by-case basis with extreme emphasis placed on protecting the general public  healthcare workers and our team members ” said Selin Hoboy  Stericycle’s vice president of legislative and regulatory affairs.  The largest Ebola outbreak to date is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa  which is centered in Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of November 2  2014  this outbreak has 13 042 reported cases resulting in 4 818 deaths.  All medical waste must be properly handled and be responsibly disposed of  but medical waste associated with the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)  a Category A infectious disease  is especially challenging for healthcare workers and medical waste disposal companies.  The patient’s profuse sweating and excretions of other bodily fluids cause widespread contamination to virtually everything in the treatment room and the head-to-toe personal protection equipment (PPE) worn by caregivers.  Current efforts to treat an infected person include giving either oral re-hydration therapy or intravenous fluids. The disease has a high risk of death  killing between 25 percent and 90 percent of those infected with the virus  averaging out at 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss  and typically follows 6 to 16 days after symptoms appear.  The virus spreads by direct contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected human or animal. Infection may also occur by direct contact with a recently contaminated item or surface. Spread of the disease through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.  The volume of medical waste associated with the disease is staggering. According to the Los Angeles Times  a single Ebola patient in a U.S. hospital will generate eight 55-gallon barrels or 440 gallons of medical waste each day. This includes virtually all material that comes in contact with the patient  like PPE worn by caregivers  bedding  instruments and food related materials. Even furniture  curtains and mattresses must be treated as contaminated.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend autoclaving or incineration of Ebola waste to destroy the microbes; however incinerating infected waste is banned in several states and must be transported to other states for incineration.  Transporting Ebola waste by road  rail or plane is also problematic. Under federal Department of Transportation (DOT) guidelines  Ebola waste is designated as a Class A infectious substance capable of causing death or disability  and requires a special permit for transport.  “The Ebola virus itself is not particularly hardy ” CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said recently before a Congressional hearing. “It’s killed by bleach  by autoclaving  or by a variety of chemicals.”  The Healthcare Coalition for Emergency Preparedness (HCEP)  an organization with the primary mission to raise awareness on healthcare facility operational sustainability during a crisis or emergency  is concerned about preparedness issues related to Ebola.  In a mid-October letter to a U.S. House of Representatives’ oversight hearing examining America’s public health response to the Ebola outbreak  Darrell A. Henry  executive director of HCEP outlined his organization’s recommendations for handling Ebola medical waste. Following are excerpts from that letter:  “We believe that there are simple solutions that can be implemented quickly  including designated treatment centers; utilize mobile triage centers; recommend more conservative protections for healthcare workers; establish protocols for patient movement; disinfect solid and liquid waste on-site as close to the source as possible; and consider deploying mobile waste sterilizers to medical centers.  “Additionally  with healthcare workers on the front lines in the battle to contain Ebola  the need for proper personal protective equipment and infection control protocols is paramount. We know that there is not much information and research on disease transmission in the healthcare setting  including the potential for infectious particles to be suspended in the air around a symptomatic patient. Thus  it only seems appropriate to adopt more conservative measures to protect healthcare providers.  “We are pleased to note that CDC has now clarified that Ebola waste is a Category A infectious material  which the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health  safety  and property when transported in commerce  and should not be treated like normal regulated medical waste.  “In addition to performing on-site sterilization of Ebola waste before it is removed from the facility  liquid Ebola waste should be disinfected before it is put into a municipal sewer system. CDC notes that the virus can be effectively killed with autoclave sterilization and bleach solutions  stating: “Ebola-associated waste that has been appropriately inactivated or incinerated is no longer infectious.”  “It is important to know that  as recent as 20 to 25 years ago  most hospitals had on-site technology (incineration) to quickly and effectively destroy any contagious waste  but that was discontinued as a result of EPA regulations to reduce toxic emissions ” Henry continued. “Today  just 20 percent of hospitals have on-site technology (autoclaves). Most institutions outsource the treatment of medical waste  trucking it through communities to a central processing center. Nearly all of the top ranked medical institutions utilize on-site sterilization technology  which is readily available and affordable.  “At Emory Medical Center  one of the Ebola patients was producing up to 40 bags of contagious waste per day. If there was an outbreak  it would be unlikely that any truck transporter would have the capability  (i.e. Haz-Mat trucks  drivers  and DOT approved containers  etc.) to safely manage this deadly material. This situation would further be complicated by insurance and regulatory challenges as hospitals are legally liable for the disinfection of any waste they produce ” Henry said.  Sol Fried  president of Cyntox Biohazards Solutions  a company based in New York City that provides nationwide disposal services of medical and biohazardous waste said the company  like most med-waste disposal companies  is not fully prepared to handle Ebola material.  “Our company is not yet certified to pick up Ebola waste products  meaning anything that has come in contact with an Ebola patient ” Fried said. “The State of New Jersey has reached out to us for special training to be certified to pick up anything that has come in contact with Ebola. That is something we are in the process of doing  which will be done over the next week or so. Our employee training should not take more than a day and will take place online.  “At the current level we are not interested in handling Ebola medical waste. I don’t know if it’s worth the money at this time. If it becomes an epidemic then it may interest us  but I don’t see it becoming that. It seems more hysteria than a real need at this time. For small amounts it’s not economically viable for us.  “Most of our customers are contracted over three and five year agreements where we are picking on a weekly or monthly basis and our profit margins are very small. You only get profits in year two or three. So for one pickup of Ebola waste we could be charging lots of money  so it really does not make sense.  “It looks like the state is going to make sure everyone’s medical waste provider is permitted to pick up Ebola waste. That’s something we may have to do because the state is requiring state facilities to contract out to an Ebola certified waste handling company.  “The liabilities for handling Ebola waste are huge as well. We’d have to contact our insurance company prior to going into such an industry and it’s probably very expensive coverage ” Fried speculated.  Training healthcare workers to properly handle Ebola related waste is another major challenge. Many hospitals and med-waste companies rely on Compliance Publishing.Com for the latest information and guidance on Ebola. Alan Rosenauer  publisher of Compliance Publishing Corporation indicated that  Compliance has been helping companies in a variety of industries by developing and maintaining on-line searchable databases of compliance information that make compliance management easier.  “We don’t train companies; rather we provide information and guidance documents which come from organizations like the CDC  DOT and WHO ” Rosenauer explained. “At the Ebola Information Center on our website we provide the latest information to help medical waste companies  hospitals and clinics understand  handle  package and transport Ebola waste properly and safely. We also e-mail the information as well as post it on our website. In fact  we just published information and guidance for transporting bulk contaminated Ebola med-waste which was sent to everyone in the industry.  “Normally we send the information to just our customers  but right now we’re sending it to every medical waste transporter to make sure everyone is fully aware.  “Training can let someone know what the standards are. What the rules on conduct are  especially with Ebola. It’s not that they are not prepared  most of them are  but they don’t know exactly what they have to do to be compliant. Up until recently there was very little guidance on who needed to do what. What are the standards for packaging? What are the standards for transportation? Do you have to get a special permit to transport? Companies may still need a special permit  it’s just that DOT has recently provided guidelines on transporting bulk Category A waste ” Rosenauer concluded.  Much of the so called “Ebola Panic” has been created by the news media and let’s hope that cooler heads prevail and this deadly disease is contained and an effective treatment is found. Now is the time for everyone in the healthcare and waste disposal industries and governments at all levels to work together and concentrate on strict procedures and protocols to prevent the spread of Ebola  including protecting our borders from carriers of this infectious disease.

Waste management companies are refusing to haul away the soiled sheets and virus-spattered protective gear associated with treating the disease  citing federal guidelines that require Ebola-related waste to be handled in special packaging by people with hazardous materials training  infectious disease and biosafety experts told Reuters.  Many U.S. hospitals are unaware of the regulatory snafu  which experts say could threaten their ability to treat any person who develops Ebola in the U.S. after coming from an infected region. It can take as long as 21 days to develop Ebola symptoms after exposure.  The issue created problems for Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  the first institution to care for Ebola patients here. As Emory was treating two U.S. missionaries who were evacuated from West Africa in August  their waste hauler  Stericycle  initially refused to handle it. Stericycle declined comment.  Ebola symptoms can include copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhea  and nurses and doctors at Emory donned full hazmat suits to protect themselves.

Emory sent staff to Home Depot to buy as many 32-gallon (120-liter) rubber waste containers with lids that they could get their hands on. Emory kept the waste in a special containment area for six days until its Atlanta neighbor  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  helped broker an agreement with Stericycle.

The worst Ebola outbreak on record is now projected to infect as many as 20 000 people in West Africa by November  while US officials have said that number could rise above 550 000 by mid-January without an international intervention to contain its spread. Experts say it is only a matter of time before at least some infected patients are diagnosed in US hospitals  most likely walking into the emergency department seeking treatment. Already there have been several scares. As of Sept. 8  as many as 10 patients have been tested by US hospitals for suspected Ebola cases  Dr. Barbara Knust  team leader for the CDC’s Ebola response  said at a medical meeting this month. All tested negative. The CDC has issued detailed guidelines on how hospitals can care for such patients  but their recommendations for handling Ebola waste differs from the US Department of Transportation  which regulates the transportation of infectious waste. CDC advises hospitals to place Ebola-infected items in leak-proof containers and discard them as they would other biohazards that fall into the category of “regulated medical waste.” According to DOT guidelines  items in this category can’t be in a form that can cause human harm. The DOT classifies Ebola as a Category A agent  or one that is potentially life-threatening. DOT regulations say transporting Category A items requires special packaging and hazmat training. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency isn’t aware of any packaging that is approved for handling Ebola waste. As a result  conventional waste management contractors believe they can’t legally haul Ebola waste  said Thomas Metzger  communication director for the National Waste & Recycling Association trade group. Part of Emory’s solution was to bring in one of the university’s large-capacity sterilizers called an autoclave  which uses pressurized steam to neutralize infectious agents  before handing the waste off to its disposal contractor for incineration. Few hospitals have the ability to autoclave medical waste from Ebola patients on site. “For this reason  it would be very difficult for a hospital to agree to care for Ebola cases - this desperately needs a fix ” said Dr Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s Public Health Committee. Dr. Gavin Macgregor-Skinner  an expert on public health preparedness at Pennsylvania State University  said there’s “no way in the world” that US hospitals are ready to treat patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola. “Where they come undone every time is the management of their liquid and solid waste ” said Macgregor-Skinner  who recently trained healthcare workers in Nigeria on behalf of the Elizabeth R. Griffin Research Foundation. Skinner said the CDC is working with DOT to resolve the issue. He said the CDC views its disposal guidelines as appropriate  and that they have been proven to prevent infection in the handling of waste from HIV  hepatitis  and tuberculosis patients. Joe Delcambre  a spokesman for DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  could not say whether requiring hospitals to first sterilize Ebola waste would resolve the issue for waste haulers. He did confirm that DOT is meeting with CDC. Metzger said his members are also meeting with officials from the DOT  the CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency to sort out the issue. Until the matter is resolved  however  “We’re bound by those regulations ” he said.  ,ebola-e6f1116e939b49f1e484d2e863c4967652a7fb52dafa6319371b5c46b04fa9ee,0,5660,2,2016-04-25 11:38:51.055361,

The apartment contents were incinerated but nearly a month later  the ashes sit in limbo at a facility in Port Arthur  Texas  as Louisiana officials fight to keep it out of a landfill there. (AP Photo/LM Otero  File) (AP Photo/LM Otero  File) Print The Associated Press	By	The Associated Press	The Associated Press	 on November 01  2014 at 7:20 AM  updated November 01  2014 at 7:31 AM View/Post Comments It took a crew 38 hours to clear out the Dallas apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before he was diagnosed Sept. 30 with Ebola. Hazmat suit-clad workers piled shoes  carpets  mattresses  bed sheets  clothes and kids' backpacks into 140 55-gallon drums. Only a few items were salvaged: a computer hard drive  legal documents  family photos  an old Bible belonging to Duncan's grandmother.  The drums were packed  decontaminated and then carted away by Cleaning Guys environmental services employees. The contents were incinerated. But nearly a month later  the ashes sit in limbo at a facility in Port Arthur  Texas  according to Veolia North America  the company that owns the facility  as Louisiana officials fight to keep it out of a landfill there.  While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says incinerated Ebola waste poses no danger  Louisiana officials earlier this month asked a judge to block Duncan's waste from entering the state  saying they wanted to determine for themselves that it was not dangerous. On Friday  state officials announced that Veolia has agreed to keep the ash out of the state's landfill.  Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell said in a statement that the agreement "ends this chapter in the controversy of transportation and disposal of Ebola waste."  But the unresolved fate of the ashes highlights the problem U.S. hospitals and communities could face in disposing of their own Ebola-related refuse.  Hospitals routinely deal with hazardous medical waste  sealing  transporting and disposing of vials of HIV-infected blood or boxes of used syringes. But Ebola waste is more problematic because of the intense fear of the virus and the sheer amount of the waste  which could include patients' clothes  their mattresses and scores of protective outfits worn and discarded by medical workers.  According to the American Hospital Association  a typical hospital patient produces roughly three pounds of waste a day  much of it not considered hazardous. However  an Ebola patient could generate eight 55-gallon drums of waste  all of it treated as highly infectious.  By contrast  there isn't much debate about what to do with ashes of Ebola waste  said Julie Damond  a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders in Dakar  Senegal. Such waste is routinely incinerated.  "We know that the virus doesn't survive heat more than about 60 degrees (Celsius) for several minutes and it is very sensitive to detergents such as chlorine. So we use both to get rid of it " she said.  In the U.S.  Ebola waste is categorized as a Class A infectious substance under federal transportation guidelines  meaning it can cause death or permanent disability. But traditional packaging requirements for Class A waste make it hard to transport such large volumes. Class A material  often needles and blood vials  are packaged inside two small water-tight containers and then placed inside a third container for transport. CDC guidelines call for Ebola-related waste to be decontaminated and bagged  then bagged a second time and placed into 55-gallon drums.  Of 123 hospitals of various sizes across the country contacted by Associated Press reporters  three said they lacked a plan for Ebola  and several others said their plans were evolving. Eleven said they had on-site incinerators for waste disposal. More than a hundred said they relied on outside contractors.  But some companies have said they can't or won't pick up Ebola waste.  After Duncan's diagnosis  Dallas County spokeswoman Lauren Trimble said the county contacted seven vendors to clean out the apartment. Cleaning Guys was "the only vendor that was responsive and met the guidelines" for that kind of waste disposal.  Clay Jenkins  the Dallas County judge overseeing the Ebola response  said fear  as well as logistics  caused some companies to balk.  "Any time we move away from science and into fear and panic  we're making it harder for our first responders to do their jobs " Jenkins said. "The idea that you can't take ash  or waste disposal companies that deal with medical waste won't handle Ebola waste — it's just crazy for people to be afraid of ashes."  Last week  the Department of Transportation developed a new permit to help solve at least the logistics part of the problem  allowing qualified companies to pick up and transport Ebola-contaminated waste from any location  be it hospital or an apartment  in place of the usual site-specific permits.  The new permits were designed to help avoid scenarios that played out in Duncan's apartment and at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital shortly after its first Ebola patients arrived in August  when the company contracted to collect its Class A medical waste refused to take the Ebola waste.  "We had some really unexpected adventures in waste management " Dr. Aneesh Mehta  the hospital's assistant director of transplant and infectious diseases  told the American Society of Microbiology in September. "We had a buildup. We in fact went to Home Depot and bought up every large trash can/sealed canister we could get and kept them in a separate room until we renegotiated our contract with our waste-management company."  That company  Stericycle  would not comment on its contract with Emory  but said in a statement it has received national approval to transport Ebola waste and is working with authorities "to address each potential and new Ebola case."  South Carolina-based Advanced Environmental Options Inc. was granted an emergency DOT permit last week to haul away Ebola waste across the Carolinas  Georgia  Tennessee  Alabama  Virginia  Kentucky and Florida. Account manager Dana West said the company can handle large volumes of hazardous waste in a variety of scenarios.  "Our client list includes government agencies  universities  schools  private industries. We do medical waste  crime scene cleanup  meth labs — you name it  we've done it " West said.  But where Ebola waste will go after it is treated is still unclear.  While Louisiana fights on  Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster has reached an agreement with a sterilization company blocking it from handling Ebola waste at its St. Louis facility.  Linda Greene  who sits on the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology Regulatory Review Panel  said the new DOT permits provide a measure of security for hospitals wondering whether their existing contractors would handle Ebola waste. But protocols are still evolving.  "You start putting plans in place for something you haven't dealt with before and begin asking all these questions " Green said. "There's a lot of discussion and problem solving that still has to occur."  ___  Associated Press reporters Lauran Neergaard in Washington  Nomaan Merchant in Dallas and Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge  La.  contributed to this report.

(Reuters) - The United States is days away from settling the critical question of how hospitals should handle and dispose of medical waste from Ebola patients  a government official said on Wednesday.  Experts have warned that conflicting U.S. regulations over how such waste should be transported could make it very difficult for U.S. hospitals to safely care for patients with Ebola  a messy disease that causes diarrhea  vomiting and in some cases  bleeding from the eyes and ears.  Like Us on Facebook  Safely handling such waste presents a dual challenge for regulators  who want to both prevent the accidental spread of the deadly disease and avert any deliberate attempts to use it as a bioweapon.  Most U.S. hospitals are not equipped with incinerators or large sterilizers called autoclaves that could accommodate the large amounts of soiled linens  contaminated syringes and virus-spattered protective gear generated from the care of an Ebola patient  said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Public Health Committee.  Sterilizing Ebola waste before it is transported is important not only to protect waste haulers but to guard against someone using the waste "for nefarious purposes " said Sean Kaufman  ‎president of Behavioral-Based Improvement Solutions  an Atlanta-based biosafety firm. "It's not just a safety issue " he said.  The matter  which was first reported by Reuters last month  may pose a significant challenge for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas  which is now treating the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed on U.S. soil.  Duchin said he is not aware of whether the hospital has its own incinerator or large autoclave  but if it does not  "they are going to have to find a temporary solution for managing infectious waste. That puts the hospital in a very difficult situation."  Cynthia Quarterman  administrator of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration  which oversees dangerous shipments  said her agency is "working on how we can clarify even further for hospitals  for the public  what the appropriate transportation should be."  Another official said that news could come within days.  The issue centers on guidance over handling Ebola-contaminated waste. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises hospitals to treat items infected with the Ebola virus in leak-proof containers and discard them as they would other biohazards that fall into the category of "regulated medical waste."  But the DOT deems Ebola a Category A infectious agent  meaning it is capable of killing people and animals  and not "regulated medical waste " a category in which pathogens are not capable of causing harm.  Waste management contractors who normally handle hazardous hospital waste say they cannot legally haul the material  which leaves hospitals stuck without a way to dispose of the waste.  Already the issue has created problems. When Emory University Hospital in Atlanta was preparing to care for two U.S. missionaries infected with Ebola in West Africa in its high-security biocontainment unit  their waste hauler  Stericycle  initially refused to handle it.  Bags of Ebola waste quickly began piling up until the hospital worked out the issues with the help of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the waste management problem has not been resolved yet  but he has said previously that the CDC is meeting with officials at the DOT to resolve the matter.  Duchin said he has heard that the discussion "has been elevated at the fed to decision makers who can solve the problem."  A DOT official said the CDC and DOT will likely issue joint guidance by next week.  (,ebola-d52f1376144b27d28749e0480901712299d88bafa9e04a8cfa01cafa5391eedc,0,4014,2,2016-04-25 14:37:21.212391,
