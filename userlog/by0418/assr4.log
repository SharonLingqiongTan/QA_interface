But there are caveats, Kieny said. The panel said ethical criteria must include full transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect of person, preservation of dignity and community involvement.  Because so little is known about safety when these treatments are provided for compassionate use, it’s important to not give false hope to anybody that ebola can be treated now, she said. “This is absolutely not the case. What we rely on now is proper implementation of infection prevention and control.”  Kieny defined compassionate use as access to an unapproved drug outside a clinical trial. There is a moral obligation to collect and share all data generated, she said in the AP video.::43d700df496be912f039f7297ebd0918::ACKNOWLEDGED 43d700df496be912f039f7297ebd0918

It’s not surprising, then, that antivaccinationists have tried to claim that vaccines are responsible for the initial Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. These conspiracy theories have profound effects dealing with health emergencies. In particular, the idea that the CDC is “hiding” something can undermine trust and facilitate the spread of misinformation. That’s just what happened last week.  ::a615f98f4e310d133ce4b2f3f7ef09ed::ACKNOWLEDGED a615f98f4e310d133ce4b2f3f7ef09ed

The conspiracy theory, published in The Event Chronicle, states that the virus does not exist and the US is lying.  The report blames the Red Cross for conspiring along with the United States to steal oil and diamond wealth. It says only those who receive treatments and injections from the Red Cross are getting the disease.  It even goes on to claim it is because of this reason that Liberia and Nigeria kicked the Red Cross out of their countries.  ::eb93a50976d32c0c452537d7bf98dee4::ACKNOWLEDGED eb93a50976d32c0c452537d7bf98dee4

His book, âEmerging Virusesâ denies that Ebola and HIV ânaturally evolvedâ and instead explores the possibility that they were manufactured germs in laboratories which were transmitted to humans via âtaintedâ vaccinations for hepatitis and smallpox. The book talks about the CIAâs possible role in all of this and previous genocides carried out by the government using man-made viruses. Unlike other theorists, however, Horowitz does not jump to the conclusion that the virus was intentionally put into vaccines for the purpose of mass murder andÂ alsoÂ discusses the possibility that the contamination of the vaccination was not intentional.  ::270f6900b6b5be24a86feadb52370b5a::ACKNOWLEDGED 270f6900b6b5be24a86feadb52370b5a

One, the tropical area hosted a plethora of undiscovered exotic diseases that could be exploited for research. Secondly, African people were seen as disposable for biochemical testing.  This is where the genocidal theory of Ebola comes from, particularly for Africans and subsequently Black Americans. Since the Africans were the first to get Ebola and AIDS, they were the first to pass it on.  ::15e08903db40446555355d2939c859b2::ACKNOWLEDGED 15e08903db40446555355d2939c859b2

With unrest in Hong Kong (Umbrella Revolution), Ukraine, the Middle East, Gaza, governments could implement strict anti-contagion policies to revoke rights to public assembly in the interest of public safety.  In fact, this summer the European Union raised its Ebola alert level to âhighâ after Germany admitted Ebola patients into its borders. This coincided with domestic German protests over Israelâs handling of Palestinian aggression in Gaza that left civilians dead on both sides. Anti-Semitic protesters in Germany gathered to protest Israel, much to the chagrin of the German government.  ::17b89cab9fa56bb349ddd75bac5be6ec::ACKNOWLEDGED 17b89cab9fa56bb349ddd75bac5be6ec

Two days ago, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Canadian Press that it’s “quite conceivable, if not likely” that fast-tracked Ebola vaccines may have to given to entire countries to get the viral outbreak under control (via Modern Healthcare):  “It is conceivable that this epidemic will not turn around even if we pour resources into it. It may just keep going and going and it might require avaccine.”  “As the epidemic gets more and more formidable and in some cases out of control it is quite conceivable, if not likely, that we may need to deploy the vaccine to the entire country to be able to shut the epidemic down. That is clearly a possibility.” [emphasis added]  The article did not specify which country in particular Dr. Fauci — whose institute just sohappens to be currently working on an experimental Ebola vaccine (the first to begin human clinical trials) with Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline — was referring to. Was he talking specifically about Sierra Leone? Liberia? Guinea? Any place where Ebola has taken hold? The entire continent of Africa? Other countries, should it break out there includingSpain or America?  ::569213be0740dacd0647e0572f7c55ae::ACKNOWLEDGED 569213be0740dacd0647e0572f7c55ae

If we apply Gates’ penchant for investing in causes which produce a hefty “return on investment” (ROI) then one could reasonably suspect that Gates is positioning himself to profit on the $50 million he has invested in the Ebola cause which conveniently includes the CDC, the holder of the patent for Ebola.The NIH presently holds all patents on Ebola vaccines.

Interestingly, Bill Gates has donated a total of $560 million dollars to the Global Fund. The Global Fund has also positioned themselves to be in charge of the distribution of the “newly developed”, and not yet announced vaccines for TB and HIV.  Since the goal is the vaccination of every man, woman and child on the planet with multiple vaccines, Gates’ $560 million contribution to the Global Fund is chump change compared to the expected ROI. However, on deck is the Ebola virus.  I was also told by my sources that the polio vaccine will be a part of the vaccination cocktail. When I asked how many vaccines are we talking about, I was told as many as two dozen vaccines will be required and forcibly administered by various levels of government. The easiest place to enforce the mandatory vaccines will be through the schools and it will include all schools, both public and private. My sources told me about pending and recently passed legislation in several states which are requiring mandatory vaccinations. In the brief time I have had to process this information, I have found enough confirming information to publish the fact that this undeniably true.     ::f1c8d8359edc01da399b29a983ff148e::ACKNOWLEDGED f1c8d8359edc01da399b29a983ff148e

And shockingly, that point is relevant to the Ebola vaccine, because as yet I have seen no evidence that Ebola virus has ever been properly identified in any human being.  Therefore, there is no evidence anyone needs protection from the virus.  As I reported several days ago [2], chemist David Rasnick, PhD, has examined published literature on Ebola, and has concluded:  “I have examined in detail the literature on isolation and EMs [EM: electron microscope pictures] of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. I have not found any convincing evidence that Ebola virus (and for that matter Marburg) has been isolated from humans. There is certainly no confirmatory evidence of human isolation.”  Therefore, the need for an Ebola vaccine (even if you believe in the theory of vaccination) is completely unproven.  ::8c565f47d3c93db68d448b8fff7b4d2c::ACKNOWLEDGED 8c565f47d3c93db68d448b8fff7b4d2c

How it started Yesterday i was with friend in her hostel, we were talking about this Ebola out break, when one of my friends, Funke brought the idea of Us playing a prank on our friends. The first suggestion was to tell people that aloe vera could cure Ebola, but we thought it would sound too ridiculous so we forgot about it.  Later that evening an idea came to me (i now regret that i did it). decided to send a BBM broadcast message to my friends, telling them that the Ministry of Health has asked everyone to bathe with salt and warm water and drink some of it.  ::c99bb66b652c000232da30a843fba194::ACKNOWLEDGED c99bb66b652c000232da30a843fba194

B Joshua, asking people to bath in salt water caught on like wildfire. Several people were woken up by repeated phone calls to heed the prophetic edict to wash in saltwater. I didn’t know about it until someone accosted me the next day on the street. âHave you bathed?â, he asked me. I thought I must have looked dirty and dishevelled until he quelled my fears and explained things to me. Arenât many Sierra Leoneans who heeded that call to wash in salt water the same ones who blame our illiterate folks of Ebola disbelief? Thankfully the fate of those Nigerians who died practising this did not befall us.  ::5def73c0d920f5c2eaba589cffcc81e3::ACKNOWLEDGED 5def73c0d920f5c2eaba589cffcc81e3

But there is something far more serious at play with ebola that vitamin C impedes. Something even more sinister than blood vessel weakening happens when ebola depletes ALL vitamin C, and that is a greatly accelerated release of blood vessel damaging cytokine IL-6. Any medical professional will be able to quickly look up the fact that vitamin C impedes the release of cytokine IL-6, which ebola causes severe releases of in blood vessel walls. Once released in huge amounts, IL-6 further irritates blood vessel walls to such an extent it can blow holes in them, and this, combined with the already weakened condition from a lack of vitamin C will cause many vessels to rupture.  ::d4f002c788e01f3627b7fec92f145067::ACKNOWLEDGED d4f002c788e01f3627b7fec92f145067

These two things working together make vitamin C the probable best first line of defense against ebola that is possible

Though scurvy is seldom fatal as a primary condition, scurvy also represents only a partial deficiency of vitamin C, the body still has a LOT of vitamin C compared to zero, which ebola causes. Absent ANY vitamin C, blood vessels become very weak and start to lose blood, and platelets become ineffective and unable to trigger clots. So death by ebola is caused by massive internal bleeding and loss of blood, which can be stopped simply by taking enormous doses of vitamin C until the immune system succeeds in killing off the virus.

It should be noted that 500 mg of vitamin C sodium ascorbate, preferably is taken before taking the hydrogen peroxide and vinegar solution keeping in mind your MMS treatment.

Humans are not able to manufacture vitamin C. Either we get enough vitamin C from our diet or the immune system will not function optimally and we will be more prone to becoming ill with various infections, Ebola included.   Throughout the medical literature there are many case histories of vitamin C curing viral and other infectious illnesses. Vitamin C activates the immune system so that it can fight any infection. How much vitamin C should you take? I would suggest taking at least 5,000mg of vitamin C on a daily basis. If you become ill with any infectious agent, take more as the body’s requirements dramatically increase when it is confronted with an infectious agent.  Intravenous vitamin C should be given to all Ebola patients. Though it has not been studied, I have no doubt that IV vitamin C would be a great benefit to any patient suffering not only from Ebola but from any infectious agent.

For example, assume 5,000mg/day of vitamin C for an adult–weighing 160 pounds. For kids, lower the dose for their size. The only real side effect of vitamin C is diarrhea and loose stools. If that happens, just lower the dose. Everybody has a different vitamin C threshold–most can tolerate large doses, a few can’t. You just have to try different doses and see how they do.

A working hypothesis is that the body’s response to the Ebola infection results in all the ascorbate being consumed. In this situation the body starts to generate ascorbate by breaking down collagen protein, which liberates ascorbate. Since collagen is what holds us together, including the blood capillaries, failure of collagen eventually causes the internal bleeding common to Ebola and Scurvy.

Scurvy is still alive and well in our 21st Century. I frequently find patients with low vitamin C levels and suffering from subclinical scurvy. Any illness increases the body’s need for vitamin C. Vitamin C therapy is inexpensive and incredibly safe. That goes for oral as well as IV forms of vitamin C. DrB

Many other antioxidants have similar virucidal effects, but vitamin C appears uniquely to be of greatest potency and clinical efficacy, as its simple chemical structure allows for it to be disseminated throughout the body with little restriction.

Vitamin C has never cured Ebola virus, or to my knowledge, accelerated its resolution. Also, to my knowledge, no attempt has even been made to utilize this phenomenal vitamin/nutrient in such a fashion.  What vitamin C has done, and this has been reported in the medical literature, is to disintegrate or otherwise inactivate every virus against which it has been tested, and many different viruses have been subjected to such experiments. As reported in my earlier article, Dr. Frederick Klenner resolved viral syndromes routinely and with dispatch by using multigram doses of vitamin C intravenously (50 grams at a time or more).

This is a treatment and not a cure, your immune system wipes out the virus, and the treatment gives your immune system time to do it. Here is what Ebola does that is fatal: It causes the complete removal of all vitamin C from the body. No one actually knows what mechanism is involved in doing this, other than a malfunction that is not permanently destructive to whatever is triggered to remove all vitamin C. All the researchers know is that vitamin C drops to zero and all the symptoms of ebola are consistent with a complete loss of vitamin C.

This would spoil their heroic intervention games that are sponsored by Big Pharma for control and high profits.  If they did check vitamin C levels, they would find most if not all are suffering from acute induced scurvy that would force them to abandon anti-viral chemical agents and intensely bolster those vitamin C levels. Dr. Cathcart states, ââ¦ all the hemorrhagic fevers are acute induced scurvy.â Yes, Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever.

Ebola virus and the other viral hemorrhagic fevers are much more likely to cause hemorrhaging before any other fatal infection has a chance to become established. This is because the virus so rapidly and totally metabolizes and consumes all available vitamin C in the bodies of the victims that an advanced stage of scurvy is literally produced after only a few days of the disease.  The scurvy is so complete that the blood vessels generally cannot keep from hemorrhaging long enough to allow an infective complication to develop. In addition, the viral hemorrhagic fevers typically only take hold and reach epidemic proportions in those populations that would already be expected to have low body stores of vitamin C, such as are found in many of the severely malnourished Africans.  In such individuals, an infecting hemorrhagic virus will often wipe out any remaining vitamin C stores before the immune systems can get the upper hand and initiate recovery. When the vitamin C stores are rapidly depleted by large infecting doses of an aggressive virus, the immune system gets similarly depleted and compromised.

This is a treatment and not a cure, your immune system wipes out the virus, and the treatment gives your immune system time to do it. Here is what Ebola does that is fatal: It causes the complete removal of all vitamin C from the body. No one actually knows what mechanism is involved in doing this, other than a malfunction that is not permanently destructive to whatever is triggered to remove all vitamin C. All the researchers know is that vitamin C drops to zero and all the symptoms of ebola are consistent with a complete loss of vitamin C.

I also thought about how important vitamin C is in the maintenance of the vascular system, and it seemed likely to me that the bleeding caused by Ebola may indeed be caused by this vitamins depletion. As it’s not a harmful treatment, someone who contracted Ebola may be grateful if someone gave it a go – the alternative isn’t great.

Jacob’s consideration that “Supplementing what is depleted might contribute to helping patients” is also spot on and deserves considerable esteem. Indeed he is “not medical”, but a recently comprehensive review found only 1/200 patients with an adverse reaction to high-dose IVC (PMC 2898816, PMD 20628650).  And … ebola symptoms are identical with scurvy and there are a number of other reasons suggesting that patients are massively depleted of vitamin C – so mega-supplementation for QOL seems judicious.

"Though scurvy is seldom fatal as a primary condition, scurvy also represents only a partial deficiency of vitamin C, the body still has a LOT of vitamin C compared to zero, which ebola causes. Absent ANY vitamin C, blood vessels become very weak and start to lose blood, and platelets become ineffective and unable to trigger clots. So death by ebola is caused by massive internal bleeding and loss of blood, which can be stopped simply by taking enormous doses of vitamin C until the immune system succeeds in killing off the virus."

Dr. Sircus even mentioned that an initial IV dose would be needed. There’s no way a person could orally take as much C as they needed to treat something like Ebola. Assuming one could even find a doctor to do IV doses, it would still cost less to do a short run of MMS.

Given the high load of viral particles nearing the end of the disease, use of oral vitamin C would be futile, as the demand would exceed the ability to absorb it. If administered early enough, intravenous (IV) vitamin C could demonstrate remarkable efficacy.

Besides Cannabis having antiretrovirals, cannabinoids are anti-inflammatory, which decreases the severity of cytokine storm. The study of cannabinoids has led to many important discoveries in immunology--not only the existence of a new physiological system (the endocannabinoid system), but also its role in the regulation of the immune system. Studies examining the effect of cannabinoids on immunity have shown that many cellular and cytokine mechanisms are suppressed by these agents.

With cannabis revered for its ability to kill viruses, Dr. Allen says that it only makes sense that the herb could prevent hemorrhaging and cell leaking, two of the deadliest factors associated with Ebola. Â  On Thursday, Gary Johnson told reporters that his comments last week regarding marijuana and Ebola were meant to imply that there are grounds for conducting additional research on the matter because certain cannabis compounds could have success in alleviating the fatality rates of this disease.

Yes, humans arenât the only critters that produce mannose-binding lectins. Red algae also produce these profusely, which allow the algae to protect themselves from invasion by viruses.  The most promising form of mannose-binding lectins is a component of the Scytonema varium red algae called Scytovirin. The protein extract was isolated by researchers from the National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Maryland in 2003. The protein contains 95 amino acids, and was found to bind to HIV-1 viral shells.

There is no need to resort to experimental nationwide Ebola vaccines as suggested by U.S. authorities and the current mafia-vaccine maker, GlaxoSmithKline.  Red algae is a key antiviral for this crazy world we are living in. Just having a healthy, strong immune system could save your life, and at least minimize your chances of getting sick where other less-propagandized sicknesses are concerned, such asÂ the âfluâ or even the common cold.Â Compounds in red algaeÂ help to greatly promote our own natural immune systems.

These viruses have similar glycoprotein envelopes.  The bottom line from this study is that mannose-binding lectins are available from plants. Yes, our body produces mannose-binding lectins and these are important factors in our immune system that allow us to fight various infections and diseases.  But the research clearly illustrates that we can supplement our bodies with plant-provided mannose-binding lectins. And for those of us who might be deficient in MBL, we can supplement with our MBLs with those provided by plants, which would include those listed above along with red algae.
