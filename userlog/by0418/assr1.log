Monoclonal antibodies are used for treating cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s Disease, ulcerative colitis, and after organ transplant. Antibodies are effective in treatment of diseases because they are similar to antibodies our own bodies produce. They attach to and destroy or neutralize specific pathogens or proteins that cause diseases or the inflammatory processes. ZMapp is a combination of three humanized antibodies that work by attacking and destroying the Ebola virus in the body.::53039eb88f095783a65a953dc2de9079::ACKNOWLEDGED 53039eb88f095783a65a953dc2de9079

This plant is able to help produce ZMapp in sufficient quantities at a rapid pace. The manufacturer of ZMapp has partnered with Icon Genetics AG and Kentucky BioProcessing, companies that specialize in the development of plant systems like this to help make Zmapp. These plants are grown in highly regulated conditions (temperature, humidity, and light), treated with the antibody of interest, and grown for a week to reproduce the antibody. The antibody is extracted from the plants and purified with special purification techniques to produce the final form of ZMapp used for treatment of Ebola.::61346c856a02fc1469c7756c7209bc08::ACKNOWLEDGED 61346c856a02fc1469c7756c7209bc08

Therefore, the data about the effectiveness of ZMapp is from animal studies and patients that have received it thus far. A recent study was published about using ZMapp in nonhuman primates that were infected with the Ebola virus. All 9 animals in the study received an injection of the virus, and after a fever was observed for at least 1 hour the experimental animals received ZMapp. Two animals in the control group, and 4 animals in the ZMapp group did not survive the infection. Three of the 7 infected animals survived (43% survival rate). Considering there is no treatment for Ebola, these are positive results for ZMapp as a potential treatment for Ebola virus.::5b6a2a9b2a18dcb2ae950baf63beae65::ACKNOWLEDGED 5b6a2a9b2a18dcb2ae950baf63beae65

As the deadliest outbreak of Ebola virus in history continues its "frightening" spread, now having taken at least 518 lives, Christian relief organization Samaritan's Purse has said that it is now directing efforts at an Ebola isolation center in Liberia.  "This is the largest outbreak of Ebola since it was first discovered in 1976 and it is the largest outbreak in Western Africa, with cases now showing up in national capital cities," said Ken Isaacs, vice president of programs and government relations for Samaritan's Purse. "Along with medical treatment, awareness and education are the keys to containing this outbreak."
