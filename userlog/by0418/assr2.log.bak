That number is very low, because Ebola is not transmitted either through the air or even through droplets, like measles or the flu. To contract Ebola, you need to be in direct physical contact, with a visibly symptomatic carrier, and even then the virus cannot pass through healthy skin but has to enter through the mouth, eyes, cuts, etc.  But that’s still a positive number, if a low one, and that means the disease spreads. But the one thing that we need to keep in mind is that the existing reproductive rate of 1-2 for Ebola is artificially much, much higher than it would be here in America, because it is derived from conditions in Central and now West Africa, where sanitary conditions are appalling and effective isolation virtually impossible. Ebola’s relatively low infection index is as high as it is almost exclusively because of burial customs in African culture, where tradition dictates that relatives wash the blood off the infected bodies by hand – blood that in the case of Ebola is extremely contagious, and there are not a lot a lot of rubber gloves or surgical masts in West Africa.  ::8acac54f9cbac04a27a4e62e203c92f0::ACKNOWLEDGED 8acac54f9cbac04a27a4e62e203c92f0

This is the measure of how many people a single infected person will themselves infect. An R-0 of 1 means each person with the illness will infect one more person. An R-0 less than one means an illness will die out as it is unable to infect new patients as fast as existing patients are cured or die. An R-0 larger than one means an illness means the illness will naturally spread. The current Ebola has an initial estimated R-0 of 2. To put that into perspective, Measles has an R-naught of 12-18. Smallpox and Polio are 6. Flu is between 2 and 3. So the current Ebola is slightly less infective than the season flu, although obviously the consequences of infection are more severe.  ::eb0a9546d887e4f4a3de5cb6ebbd645a::ACKNOWLEDGED eb0a9546d887e4f4a3de5cb6ebbd645a

Known as R0, or "R-naught", this is a basic measure of its infectivity. Ebola's current R0 value is between 1.7 and 2.0, which means that every ten people who become infected will probably pass the virus onto another 17-20 people before they either die or fight the virus off. The R0 value varies in different areas of west Africa, and is typically highest in places where health education messages have either not reached the community or are being ignored.  Luckily, Ebola's RO measure is actually relatively low compared to some other illnesses. Measles - a far more infectious disease - has an R0 value about 18, while a common cold has an R0 value of between two and three. This reflects the fact that while Ebola is highly lethal when it infects someone - at least 40 per cent of people usually die - the virus is actually quite poor at "host to host" transmission. Rather than being airborne, like the common cold, it is passed on only by bodily fluids, and even then, detergents such as chlorine or hand sanitiser will kill it off.  ::3820b4c7432884719c8932e59190eaf1::ACKNOWLEDGED 3820b4c7432884719c8932e59190eaf1

Each infected individual is estimated to infect 1.44 to 2.26 further individuals (the number varies depending on country). This figure is known as the basic reproductive rate, or R0 (pronounced R-naught). In order for the rate of spread to be reversed and the outbreak to be brought under control, the R0 needs to drop below one. In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to achieve this is to remove infected people from the community, and treat them in a setting that utilises PPE and infection control to limit potential spread.  ::fb428cb60a58888fb585675b6cbc412d::ACKNOWLEDGED fb428cb60a58888fb585675b6cbc412d

Why 70%?  In a hypothetical scenario, the epidemic begins to decrease and eventually end if approximately 70% of persons with Ebola are in medical care facilities or Ebolatreatment units (ETUs) or, when these settings are at capacity, in a non-ETU setting such that there is a reduced risk for disease transmission (including safe burial when needed)  To simplify, take a situation where the R0 is 2.0, you have 1000 infected individuals, and you have 700 beds available. That will take 70% of patients out of the community, and (on the assumption that infection controls are effectively maintained) prevent them passing on the infection.  The remaining 300 individuals you are unable to quarantine will then go on, statistically, to infect 600 people (300 patients, R0 of 2, 600 new infections).  In this scenario, the next generation of infected patients numbers less than the previous one - the rate of infection is in decline. If you have 700 beds, there are now also more beds than infected people, allowing all infected people to enter a healthcare environment and prevent wild transmission in the community.  ::44e9269cb4b27461475ea452371b4a37::ACKNOWLEDGED 44e9269cb4b27461475ea452371b4a37

In theory Ebola is only restrained by its generation/incubation time and possibly its methods of transmission. Ebola poses a very real threat considering the high mortality rate and lack of effective treatments available in the event of rapid transmission. Isolation is a significant part of combating the virus since its R0 drops to around 0.13 once a patient has been quarantined.           ::02b7785fdcc1c5d682352597cf47f7e0::ACKNOWLEDGED 02b7785fdcc1c5d682352597cf47f7e0

Its R0 value (said “R-naught”) is just two, meaning that during an average outbreak an average diseased person will infect two other people before either dying or beating the disease. That might sound alarming, but notice that many other diseases have much higher R0 values — SARS has an R0 value of 4, Measles of 18. Ebola is actually quite inept at host-to-host transmission, as unlike most virulent diseases it is not contagious until the infected start showing visible symptoms.  This makes disease carriers immobile and simple to spot; in theory, it ought to be easy to avoid new infections. While there is no cure for Ebola, quarantine does work at ending new infections — and thanks to the digital age, it’s never been easier to track interactions.  ::43f102b647923a56fec85ef24e58fa4c::ACKNOWLEDGED 43f102b647923a56fec85ef24e58fa4c

However, building a robot that could safely and reliably do the job, while being respectful of the remains and the victims' families, is a challenger.

Program manager Gill Pratt launched the DRC in response to another disaster, the triple meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011.  According to Pratt, both the ongoing Fukushima crisis and the Ebola outbreak point to a big gap between what we wish robots could do and what they actually can do. The machines competing in the DRC may look like a capable, even deadly, bunch, but theyre just babies when it comes to doing things for themselves, which is the whole point of disaster robots. Ultimately, you want machines that can do what a human could do, and also could enter highly radioactive or contaminated areas.  ::73175eff87cdacd19558258f3b266720::ACKNOWLEDGED 73175eff87cdacd19558258f3b266720

The second way Goldberg says robots can play a part in the Ebola fight in the long term is by inserting IVs either for drawing blood or providing intravenous hydration. Technology could help cut down on the occurrences of patients being poked multiple times to tap a good vein.  "::75fc7c8f1d047669cc2e763d52113639::ACKNOWLEDGED 75fc7c8f1d047669cc2e763d52113639

Tennessee-based  Lumalier Corp., for example, already has two sanitation robots deployed in Liberia that are tasked with automatically decontaminating hospital rooms with ultraviolet light to destroy viruses. Disinfecting technology is already in use in U.S. hospitals so there's no denying it works.  While robots can indeed take the place of humans in many ways to ultimately prevent infection, using them in the field also has challenges. For one, only robots that can be sterilized with gases and heat can be used. Most robots are typically built using delicate components and this can hamper their use in affected countries in West Africa.  ::3a624beed1b143128015377a190b399f::ACKNOWLEDGED 3a624beed1b143128015377a190b399f

The team also trained international health care workers on how to use the facility's equipment.  Although the 633rd Medical Group allegedly had no exposure to the Ebola virus or to Ebola victims during its time in Africa, the U.S. military is still taking every precaution to prevent Ebola from spreading in the U.S., should one or more of the military's recently returned service members fall ill with the virus. Everyone involved with the mission is being monitored twice daily for three weeks after their return to the U.S., and so far, no symptoms of the virus have been reported.  ::2c0148201696027858d1ed53ffc0ce46::ACKNOWLEDGED 2c0148201696027858d1ed53ffc0ce46

You see, thereâs almost nothing that a human can do (task-wise) that robo-replacements canât: food and medicine delivery, body burials, even disinfecting contaminated areas.

The robot, called TRU-D, uses UVC light to break down any organisms’ DNA, including staph, viruses and even Ebola.  “Ebola does a very horrible thing, one of the first things it does is it kills all the health care workers because it spreads so rapidly from person to person,” says Dr. Jeffery Deal, director of health studies for Water Missions International in North Charleston, South Carolina. “Ten to 15 percent of the victims right now are health care workers. It is the ultimate hospital acquired infection. That’s exactly what we designed this thing to combat.”  ::f61d2050aafea82cb06262ad55c17ea6::ACKNOWLEDGED f61d2050aafea82cb06262ad55c17ea6

Perhaps the best example of how a robot can be useful is cleaning up and decontaminating a room that has had Ebola patients in it, and has a lot of contaminated stuff in it. Obviously, if you could have a robot do that, and do it effectively, it would be safer than having a human being dealing with all of that contaminated waste and mess.  ::dc6981abfc1b930309475a0996d54d52::ACKNOWLEDGED dc6981abfc1b930309475a0996d54d52

A robot that could perform even some of the tasks of a human, such as waste removal or the burial of bodies, would have significant lifesaving potential. So, with the assistance of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, scientists are planning a series of brainstorming meetings. The first round will be held Nov. 7 at four locations: Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts; Texas A&M; the University of California, Berkeley; and in Washington.  The problem, scientists say, is that the technology is still limited when it comes to medicine. While mobile robots now can disarm roadside bombs and drive cars, they are taking only the first tentative steps toward the human levels of dexterity required in health care.  ::0bb03f4cc290c2cdef8cf654f32cb134::ACKNOWLEDGED 46633476b29b130ba9686ce4eb10af99

Deal, two TRU-D SmartUVC devices continue to aid in the battle against the Ebola virus outbreak at JFK and ELWA hospitals.  Deal, a Fellow in the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, traveled to the Republic of Liberia on Aug. 18 to lead the installment of the robots and the training of hospital staff to operate the devices. History was made on Aug. 20, as the first automated decontamination system to be used in Africa was activated at 2:30 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time. TRU-D worked around the clock to disinfect a number of hospital environments, making them safer for health care workers, volunteers, patients and family members.

Instead of putting humans into harm’s way, why not just send in a robot? Robots can’t develop symptoms from Ebola, they are relatively easy to disinfect (except for their wheels), they dutifully carry out tasks without talking back and they can dispose of hazardous waste efficiently.  Scratch the surface, though, and you can start to see the moral and philosophical questions that arise once robots start doing more than just grunt-level decontamination work. In short, everything changes once robots also become human-like caregivers of Ebola patients rather than just repurposed industrial robots. Even assuming that wise and highly moral technologists have created robots according to something approximating Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, there still exists all kinds of potential for things to go wrong as robots go about trying to observe these laws. Just read any of Asimov’s “Robot” stories  (or, better yet, watch the Will Smith movie) to understand how things might go awry.  ::209b2f03589835a37fc8594767344f65::ACKNOWLEDGED 209b2f03589835a37fc8594767344f65
