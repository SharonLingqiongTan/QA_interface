It’s not surprising  then  that antivaccinationists have tried to claim that vaccines are responsible for the initial Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. These conspiracy theories have profound effects dealing with health emergencies. In particular  the idea that the CDC is “hiding” something can undermine trust and facilitate the spread of misinformation. That’s just what happened last week.  ,ebola-2933e9cc7658753b8645915e1e9e264b8f7d7121d92a4ce29d76e59b73c5b6c8,0,605,4,2016-04-14 09:48:39.948398,

The conspiracy theory  published in The Event Chronicle  states that the virus does not exist and the US is lying.  The report blames the Red Cross for conspiring along with the United States to steal oil and diamond wealth. It says only those who receive treatments and injections from the Red Cross are getting the disease.  It even goes on to claim it is because of this reason that Liberia and Nigeria kicked the Red Cross out of their countries.  ,ebola-5856f217e73d045c552e1c6d28f3cf6c8b995c7a22f993613ffce627e923645d,0,619,4,2016-04-14 09:52:34.370927,

A post allegedly written by a man from Ghana named Nana Kwame claims that the Ebola virus is not actually a real virus  but rather a sickness that West Africans are getting from vaccines administered by the Red Cross.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,587,.Â Ebola is a form of bioterrorism created by the United States government.Â Along the same vein as the above theory  Dr. Cyril Broderick  Professor of Plant Pathology at Delaware StateÂ University has written an article claiming that Ebola did not originate from a childâs contact with a bat from the Congo  as health officials have reported. Dr. Broderick instead alleges that the Ebola virus has been being manufactured for years  along with the HIV virus  and tested on African children âunder the guise of vaccinations.â TheÂ reason Broderick cites for this actually has nothing to do with oil or diamonds  but rather aÂ method of war tactic that countries with CIA-type security agenciesÂ are using to fight one another.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,593,Dr. Leonard Horowitz  a longtime advocate against vaccines and an âauthority on public healthâ has been researching the creation of of both Ebola and HIV for many years. His book  âEmerging Virusesâ denies that Ebola and HIV ânaturally evolvedâ and instead explores the possibility that they were manufactured germs in laboratories which were transmitted to humans via âtaintedâ vaccinations for hepatitis and smallpox. The book talks about the CIAâs possible role in all of this and previous genocides carried out by the government using man-made viruses. Unlike other theorists  however  Horowitz does not jump to the conclusion that the virus was intentionally put into vaccines for the purpose of mass murder andÂ alsoÂ discusses the possibility that the contamination of the vaccination was not intentional.  ,ebola-55a1415d17b7a992dd148854f008d7deee3a01578233377ec1f959f3818c8b80,0,832,4,2016-04-14 10:04:15.388000,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,645,The theorists argue that the carelessness of U.S. government health agencies has led to the accidental deployment of a particular strain of Ebola different from anything seen before in the history of Ebola outbreaks — and it’s mutating far faster than any other Ebola strain.        ,ebola-5038a27de35778247694fb030b131ade4c14f3d5fc7181ccd031ea4deca5e58d,0,283,4,2016-04-14 10:29:46.357458,

D of Diverse Health Services (ww.diversehealthservices.com) in 2012  the hypothesis presented in the video can be summarized that Ebola  and other plagues like AIDS and sarcoma  were developed by the Department of Defense in the 1960s and 70s after failed attempts to find a âcancer vaccine.â A cancer epidemic was unintentionally begun in the United States with the creation and implementation of the polio vaccine among children in 1952.  The polio vaccine was developed from monkey kidney tissue  and in the process of being inoculated against polio  children were unknowingly also injected with various âmonkey virusesâ  many of which cause cancer.  Dr. Tentâs theory draws from earlier versions of Ebola origin theories  the most renowned of which is by Leonard G.

This is where the genocidal theory of Ebola comes from  particularly for Africans and subsequently Black Americans.

Two days ago  Dr. Anthony Fauci  director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases  told The Canadian Press that it’s “quite conceivable  if not likely” that fast-tracked Ebola vaccines may have to given to entire countries to get the viral outbreak under control (via Modern Healthcare):  “It is conceivable that this epidemic will not turn around even if we pour resources into it. It may just keep going and going and it might require avaccine.”  “As the epidemic gets more and more formidable and in some cases out of control it is quite conceivable  if not likely  that we may need to deploy the vaccine to the entire country to be able to shut the epidemic down. That is clearly a possibility.” [emphasis added]  The article did not specify which country in particular Dr. Fauci — whose institute just sohappens to be currently working on an experimental Ebola vaccine (the first to begin human clinical trials) with Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline — was referring to.

I was told that within two weeks  Ebola will be diagnosed in at least 40 states and the media cover-up will likely still be in play by this time and then the American people will be hit with shock and awe media coverage designed to frighten very American into compliance in terms of receiving a series of mandatory vaccines.  ,ebola-1896fcce3a6d1f136f42c8c8187d5dd01040ca00cc2cd99407caf572d5ed237e,0,377,3,2016-04-14 11:51:44.847011,

Do you realize the enormous profits that can be realized by vaccinating every child in the third world? If we apply Gates’ penchant for investing in causes which produce a hefty “return on investment” (ROI) then one could reasonably suspect that Gates is positioning himself to profit on the $50 million he has invested in the Ebola cause which conveniently includes the CDC  the holder of the patent for Ebola.The NIH presently holds all patents on Ebola vaccines.

Interestingly  Bill Gates has donated a total of $560 million dollars to the Global Fund. The Global Fund has also positioned themselves to be in charge of the distribution of the “newly developed”  and not yet announced vaccines for TB and HIV.  Since the goal is the vaccination of every man  woman and child on the planet with multiple vaccines  Gates’ $560 million contribution to the Global Fund is chump change compared to the expected ROI. However  on deck is the Ebola virus.  I was also told by my sources that the polio vaccine will be a part of the vaccination cocktail. When I asked how many vaccines are we talking about  I was told as many as two dozen vaccines will be required and forcibly administered by various levels of government. The easiest place to enforce the mandatory vaccines will be through the schools and it will include all schools  both public and private. My sources told me about pending and recently passed legislation in several states which are requiring mandatory vaccinations.

And shockingly  that point is relevant to the Ebola vaccine  because as yet I have seen no evidence that Ebola virus has ever been properly identified in any human being.  Therefore  there is no evidence anyone needs protection from the virus.  As I reported several days ago [2]  chemist David Rasnick  PhD  has examined published literature on Ebola  and has concluded:  “I have examined in detail the literature on isolation and EMs [EM: electron microscope pictures] of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. I have not found any convincing evidence that Ebola virus (and for that matter Marburg) has been isolated from humans. There is certainly no confirmatory evidence of human isolation.”  Therefore  the need for an Ebola vaccine (even if you believe in the theory of vaccination) is completely unproven.  ,ebola-dc980169c08c17a235cb08a57f8a8f483632405a32645af6e9a91e58cbba7327,0,963,4,2016-04-15 08:58:50.842126,

The wildly accusatory article  by Dr. Cyril Broderick  a former professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Liberia’s College of Agriculture and Forestry  claims the Ebola virus–and HIV–are products of the Cold War. Titled “Ebola  AIDS Manufactured By Western Pharmaceuticals  US DoD?” Broderick’s article claims–using evidence such as the science fiction novel The Hot Zone–that the Department of Defense unwittingly used Africans to test experimental bioweapons by pretending they were vaccinating them against disease. “Reports ” he argues  without actually citing any reports  “narrate stories of the US Department of Defense (DoD) funding Ebola trials on humans  trials which started just weeks before the Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Sierra Leone.”  ,ebola-2303fe0e95b4f48838c64927cacf5bd6ae32a9c224e72328d8536c006d055c5a,0,1050,4,2016-05-06 09:24:38.293664,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,8198,It is interesting that the DOD purchased 160 000 inadequate biohazard suits  knowing full well that they are putting people at risk .. perhaps they didn’t realize people would realize the obvious. What is of further concern is that the thousands of military personnel sent to Africa have compromised suits to wear  which can only be construed as an intentional effort to bring the virus to the US … but the virus is not easily spread  anyway … but the fear mongering is the real problem  because it is part of a sociopolitical control dynamic in play. What with the proliferation of false flags with crisis actors  this whole thing is 90% false flag hype  10% incompetence by administrations that are more interested in control and manipulation of the minds of populations for political purposes than anything else. There are many other issues that have arisen  as well. People have been caught putting formaldehyde in wells in Liberia  confessing to have been paid to do so (creates symptoms of Ebola and is fatal). All the countries in Africa that have these problems are also areas in which USAMRIID (US biological warfare program) operates  and they are countries that have vital natural resources … it doesn’t take much to conclude that depopulation of these areas is the overall agenda. ,ebola-3ee907151779b769c17e559e061a1abdeba786647c8c72da1b040a9673d6bc0c,838,2131,4,2016-05-06 09:35:51.379086,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,8202,This realization has given rise to the discussion that the circulating strain of Ebola observed today may indeed be a bioengineered weapon whose purpose is to radically reduce the world population of human beings. After all  some of the most influential people in the world — like Bill Gates and Ted Turner — continue to openly call for sharp reductions in global population in order to save the planet from the destructive ways of the human race.  ,ebola-8c15f5ed317b659ab6e253ed01730c6faac7cc8f11f1b9db41e01678c5427c57,0,449,4,2016-05-06 09:43:18.491810,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,8205,This may explain why such research may be taking place in Africa. Conducting bioweapons research on the African continent  away from the prying eyes of the U.S. media  allows such operations to be conducted in a covert manner with the necessary deniability.  Strategically  there is no question that a world power nation like the United States would never abandon its intellectual capital into bioweapons research. The banning of the research by President Nixon was merely a public relations and diplomacy strategy in much the same way that nuclear nations frequently talk about “disarmament” while building more nuclear missiles.  No nation can strategically allow itself to be wholly unprepared against an Ebola attack from an enemy nation  therefore Ebola bioweapons research must always be continued in order to research potential defenses against it (even if the bioweapon is never intended to be used as a tool of aggression). The only rational conclusion here is that the Pentagon never really halted Ebola bioweapons research but instead moved it offshore.  ,ebola-8c15f5ed317b659ab6e253ed01730c6faac7cc8f11f1b9db41e01678c5427c57,0,1066,4,2016-05-06 09:44:33.519715,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,8259,The Ebola threat has triggered various conspiracy theories. The fact that the US federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) patented the Ebola virus has added fuel to the fire. According to the US patent number 20120251502  the owner of "Human Ebola Virus Species and Compositions and Methods Thereof" is "the Government of the US as Represented by the Secretary of the Department of Health." The New York Times reported on October 18  2014  that "accusations appeared online contending that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention… was poised to make a fortune from a new vaccine it had created with the pharmaceutical industry."  Meanwhile  the Daily Observer  Liberia’s main English-language newspaper  claims that the US and European countries benefit from the mess in West Africa that has been caused by the deadly disease. The media outlet suggests that the infection of the population of the African states might be deliberate  and points the finger at vaccination programs carried out by the WHO and Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF  also known as Doctors Without Borders). While the medical organizations and pharma firms are using Africans as "Guinea pigs " the developed powers are conducting post-colonial bio-warfare in order to maintain control over resource-rich West Africa  noted Dr. Cyril Broderick  a former Professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Liberia’s College of Agriculture and Forestry  in his article "Ebola  AIDS Manufactured By Western Pharmaceuticals  US DoD?" published in the Daily Observer in September 2014.  ,ebola-187bbf20655942f210d7dbce18b9c52866a9f8b8389c79f02e823d6861d8ab97,0,1580,4,2016-05-06 10:50:01.372146,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,55,The Claims,10185,. Reason 1: This vaccine implemented sickness being "called" Ebola was introduced into West Africa for the end goal of getting troops on the ground in Nigeria  Liberia  and Sierra Leone. If you remember America was just trying to get into Nigeria for "Boko Haram" #BULLSHIT but that fell apart when Nigerians started telling the truth. There ARE NO GIRLS MISSING. Global support fell through the floor  and a new reason was needed to get troops into Nigeria and steal the new oil reserves they have discovered. Reason 2: Sierra Leone is the World's Largest Supplier of Diamonds. For the past 4 months they have been on strike  refusing to provide diamonds due to horrible working conditions and slave pay. The West will not pay a fair wage for the resources because the idea is to keep these people surviving on rice bags and foreign aid so that they remain a source of cheap slave labor forever. A reason was also needed to get troops on the ground in Sierra Leone to force an end to the diamond miners strikes. This is not the first time this has been done. When miners refuse to work troops are sent in and even if they have to kill and replace them all  the only desire is to get diamonds back flowing out of the country. Of course to launch multiple campaigns to invade these countries separately would be way too fishy. But something like "Ebola" allows access to an entire area simultaneously... Reason 3: In addition to stealing Nigerian oil  and forcing Sierra Leone back to mining  troops have also been sent in to FORCE vaccinations (Deadly "Ebola" Poison) onto those Africans who are not foolish enough to take them willingly. 3000 troops are being sent in to make sure that this "poison" continues to spread  because again it is only spread through vaccination. As more and more news articles are released as they have been in Liberia  informing the populous of the US lies and manipulation  more and more Africans are refusing to visit the Red Cross. Troops will force these vaccinations upon the people to ensure the visible appearance of an Ebola pandemic. In addition to this they will protect the Red Cross from the Liberians and Nigerians who have been rightfully ejecting them from their countries. Reason 4: Last but not least  the APPEARANCE of this Ebola "pandemic" (should Americans not catch on) will be used to scare the countless millions into taking an "Ebola vaccine" which in reality is the pandemic. Already they have started with stories of how it has been brought to the US and has appeared in Dallas  how white doctors were cured but black infected are not being allowed to be treated  etc. ALL that will do is make blacks STRIVE to get the vaccine  because it appears that the "cure" is being held back from blacks. They will run out in droves to get it and then there will be serious problems. With all we have seen revealed about vaccines this year you would think we learned our lesson.

The prestigious Rockefeller Foundation appears to have already mapped out our future for us:  “The pandemic also had a deadly effect on economies: international mobility of both people and goods screeched to a halt  debilitating industries like tourism and breaking global supply chains.”  The present Ebola scare is fast fitting perfectly into Rockefeller’s ‘Flu pandemic’ mind-scaping exercise.

The idea is to keep the workers remaining a source of cheap slave labor forever. Corporations control military agendas  and the diamond cartels are some of the historically most entrenched.

Patents are filed in order to claim monopoly ownership over an invention.

"Apparently  the market-driven economics of health care do not have an answer to a virus that begins in a part of the world where there isn’t much money " the priest notes. However  since the virus has reached the shores of the developed countries  the epidemic has turned into a "business case."  ,ebola-187bbf20655942f210d7dbce18b9c52866a9f8b8389c79f02e823d6861d8ab97,0,590,4,2016-05-06 10:48:57.604576, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,358,Ebola Conspiracy Theories,56,Origins,8258,The Ebola threat has triggered various conspiracy theories. The fact that the US federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) patented the Ebola virus has added fuel to the fire. According to the US patent number 20120251502  the owner of "Human Ebola Virus Species and Compositions and Methods Thereof" is "the Government of the US as Represented by the Secretary of the Department of Health." The New York Times reported on October 18  2014  that "accusations appeared online contending that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention… was poised to make a fortune from a new vaccine it had created with the pharmaceutical industry."  Meanwhile  the Daily Observer  Liberia’s main English-language newspaper  claims that the US and European countries benefit from the mess in West Africa that has been caused by the deadly disease. The media outlet suggests that the infection of the population of the African states might be deliberate  and points the finger at vaccination programs carried out by the WHO and Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF  also known as Doctors Without Borders). While the medical organizations and pharma firms are using Africans as "Guinea pigs " the developed powers are conducting post-colonial bio-warfare in order to maintain control over resource-rich West Africa  noted Dr. Cyril Broderick  a former Professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Liberia’s College of Agriculture and Forestry  in his article "Ebola  AIDS Manufactured By Western Pharmaceuticals  US DoD?" published in the Daily Observer in September 2014.  ,ebola-187bbf20655942f210d7dbce18b9c52866a9f8b8389c79f02e823d6861d8ab97,0,1580,4,2016-05-06 10:49:56.095238,

What they have in common is that they all suddenly deplete all of the victims vitamin C causing acute induced systemic scurvy,ebola-576bc2735ef195e81785e2440e5097242b64ab2c7646ab56066c97b3e8fb3717,0,239,1,2016-04-15 12:55:54.925415, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1501,How vitamin C works to stop the damage from ebola (though vitamin C is NOT a cure) First of all  as anyone who knows about scurvy can state  vitamin C helps blood vessel walls keep their strength. But there is something far more serious at play with ebola that vitamin C impedes. Something even more sinister than blood vessel weakening happens when ebola depletes ALL vitamin C  and that is a greatly accelerated release of blood vessel damaging cytokine IL-6. Any medical professional will be able to quickly look up the fact that vitamin C impedes the release of cytokine IL-6  which ebola causes severe releases of in blood vessel walls. Once released in huge amounts  IL-6 further irritates blood vessel walls to such an extent it can blow holes in them  and this  combined with the already weakened condition from a lack of vitamin C will cause many vessels to rupture.  ,ebola-e6c422e8879ec44791263ef8ba864b05fb3134f2bf2de053a9c214ef92c2853c,0,877,4,2016-04-15 13:01:26.347718,

Yet  in all the headlines and media stories surrounding this epidemic  not one word is spoken of the proven intravenous use of vitamin C as a cure.

As extraordinary as this might sound there is NO VIRUS yet investigated that a sustained high dose of vitamin C  given intravenously  or in high and continuous oral doses  hasn't killed off or substantially suppressed.

These two things working together make vitamin C the probable best first line of defense against ebola that is possible,ebola-06c7cbb9d4d6fab3c0609df09ee8962a6e6390ed7c45813c2cf20864d6f9450a,4,375,3,2016-04-18 07:58:31.903041,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1800,The very first symptoms of ebola are exactly the same as scurvy  which is caused by inadequate vitamin C. Though scurvy is seldom fatal as a primary condition  scurvy also represents only a partial deficiency of vitamin C  the body still has a LOT of vitamin C compared to zero  which ebola causes. Absent ANY vitamin C  blood vessels become very weak and start to lose blood  and platelets become ineffective and unable to trigger clots. So death by ebola is caused by massive internal bleeding and loss of blood  which can be stopped simply by taking enormous doses of vitamin C until the immune system succeeds in killing off the virus.  ,ebola-5a41ddfbf8b8550fc87571018461890db75edf4cf032d55f90e85c2b8f12d029,0,641,3,2016-04-18 08:02:15.993148,

Use 1/2 cap of 3% H2O2 plus 1 cap of vinegar  in one liter of drinking water.  Drink this 1/2 glass of water every 45-50 minutes for a total of 5 doses.  It should be noted that 500 mg of vitamin C sodium ascorbate  preferably is taken before taking the hydrogen peroxide and vinegar solution keeping in mind your MMS treatment.  ,ebola-5a41ddfbf8b8550fc87571018461890db75edf4cf032d55f90e85c2b8f12d029,0,431,3,2016-04-18 08:03:06.852625, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1806,The most important item is vitamin C. Humans are not able to manufacture vitamin C. Either we get enough vitamin C from our diet or the immune system will not function optimally and we will be more prone to becoming ill with various infections  Ebola included.   Throughout the medical literature there are many case histories of vitamin C curing viral and other infectious illnesses. Vitamin C activates the immune system so that it can fight any infection. How much vitamin C should you take? I would suggest taking at least 5 000mg of vitamin C on a daily basis. If you become ill with any infectious agent  take more as the body’s requirements dramatically increase when it is confronted with an infectious agent.  Intravenous vitamin C should be given to all Ebola patients. Though it has not been studied  I have no doubt that IV vitamin C would be a great benefit to any patient suffering not only from Ebola but from any infectious agent. ,ebola-86e0180cf93e74ffbf723c85ee6757759191a5f38d9edda195f27af1db9024f9,0,947,3,2016-04-18 08:04:32.469481,

If that happens  just lower the dose. Everybody has a different vitamin C threshold–most can tolerate large doses  a few can’t.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1812,I would think very large doses of ‘ vitamin c ‘  AKA Ascorbate  would be particularly helpful to people infected with Ebola for the following reason: Death by Ebola and death by acute Scurvy have similar symptoms  namely the failure of the endothelium and internal bleeding. A working hypothesis is that the body’s response to the Ebola infection results in all the ascorbate being consumed. In this situation the body starts to generate ascorbate by breaking down collagen protein  which liberates ascorbate. Since collagen is what holds us together  including the blood capillaries  failure of collagen eventually causes the internal bleeding common to Ebola and Scurvy.  ,ebola-86e0180cf93e74ffbf723c85ee6757759191a5f38d9edda195f27af1db9024f9,0,674,2,2016-04-18 08:06:15.027394,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1847,Anthony  you may never see a conclusive answer reported in the media about vitamin C and Ebola. What you will see is the new vaccine  which will be marketed by the pharmaceutical industry.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1862,One thing I would like to immediately clarify. Vitamin C has never cured Ebola virus  or to my knowledge  accelerated its resolution. Also  to my knowledge  no attempt has even been made to utilize this phenomenal vitamin/nutrient in such a fashion.  What vitamin C has done  and this has been reported in the medical literature  is to disintegrate or otherwise inactivate every virus against which it has been tested  and many different viruses have been subjected to such experiments. As reported in my earlier article  Dr. Frederick Klenner resolved viral syndromes routinely and with dispatch by using multigram doses of vitamin C intravenously (50 grams at a time or more).  ,ebola-2b2ff4537f1156d9cc78235b2b3b256d73f099394e5f30757bfe1e38e998469c,0,680,3,2016-04-18 08:33:58.214659, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1869,It is safe to assume but sad to admit that the majority of people including health care professional still remain ignorant about the powerful  vigorous  fierce  potent and extraordinary effects of vitamin C (did we use enough adjectives here to relay this point?) in treating  curing and preventing all forms infectious diseases and/or toxins. In the words of one of the leading vitamin C researchers Dr. Thomas Levy:  ,ebola-4ec7be24531a7334cf0591e940007b550ec00a3de0a3c81e44f2066f21cc79df,0,419,3,2016-04-18 08:37:03.102046, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1870,Intravenous vitamin C is a powerful treatment when people are on the edge between life and death from hemorrhagic fevers with the power to bring people back from the brink. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is known to perform many critical functions within the body involving detoxification  tissue building  immune enhancement  pain control  and controlling or killing pathogenic organisms.  ,ebola-4ec7be24531a7334cf0591e940007b550ec00a3de0a3c81e44f2066f21cc79df,0,386,3,2016-04-18 08:37:26.901839, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1872,If you suspect you might be infected  the very first thing to do is  1. Isolate yourself from others so that you don’t spread the disease. 2. Stay fully hydrated (Organic Coconut Water) 3. Don’t Stress 4.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1875,Here is the treatment  complete with MOA. This is a treatment and not a cure  your immune system wipes out the virus  and the treatment gives your immune system time to do it. Here is what Ebola does that is fatal: It causes the complete removal of all vitamin C from the body. No one actually knows what mechanism is involved in doing this  other than a malfunction that is not permanently destructive to whatever is triggered to remove all vitamin C. All the researchers know is that vitamin C drops to zero and all the symptoms of ebola are consistent with a complete loss of vitamin C.  ,ebola-48a31cc58993df4176b94a4e9ddb9a297f203f76e2380e47f7fa59edb1bcda81,0,591,3,2016-04-18 08:40:05.084917, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1876,According to Robert F. Cathcart III  MD  an orthomolecular physician who administers mega-dose IV vitamin C  the CDC and WHO field workers on location refuse to check blood levels of vitamin C among the diseased Africans. This would spoil their heroic intervention games that are sponsored by Big Pharma for control and high profits.  If they did check vitamin C levels  they would find most if not all are suffering from acute induced scurvy that would force them to abandon anti-viral chemical agents and intensely bolster those vitamin C levels. Dr. Cathcart states  ââ¦ all the hemorrhagic fevers are acute induced scurvy.â Yes  Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever.  ,ebola-947b2c5c8f3078e20369d7d1c057b4d72711450a312d1383a27ba89f45535a23,0,669,3,2016-04-18 08:41:09.420473,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1886,The other treatment of Ebola that I have read about is Vitamin C. Vitamin C  or ascorbic acid  is a very common chemical you can buy in tablet form at the health food store or in large quantities from bakery suppliers  or even on Ebay. The quantities of Vitamin C that you have to take to knock down a virus  any virus  including Ebola  is staggering. ,ebola-8f5d830608712588c5759abac32c81dfc6d6c7babc57b63f2314d9c066e0c55e,0,352,2,2016-04-18 08:47:41.717196,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1889,In the United States  to minimize the damage done by this deadly virus  let’s arm every hospital with highly effective (proven) natural medicines like  magnesium salts  sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)  iodine  selenium and vitamin C – which are concentrated nutritional substances with lifesaving properties.  Well documented in the medical literature  we can kill infections before they cause irreversible damage.  ,ebola-f5d8c4080dc95163eb20e8f5c67eab722eb468db1f87edcf3577c89ed1366acf,0,417,2,2016-04-18 08:51:27.141885, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1890,But  if you do get infected – what is the solution? Dr. Levy says  “when addressed in the first few days to a week of a significant exposure or a clinical infection  an aggressive regimen of vitamin C can be expected to routinely resolve the infection and eliminate the virus from the body.”  ,ebola-f5d8c4080dc95163eb20e8f5c67eab722eb468db1f87edcf3577c89ed1366acf,0,293,3,2016-04-18 08:52:07.150306, 
1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1891,In the classic form of scurvy  which evolves very slowly from the gradual depletion of vitamin C body stores  the immune system will be sufficiently compromised for infection to claim the patient’s life before the extensive hemorrhage that occurs after all vitamin C stores have been completely exhausted.  Ebola virus and the other viral hemorrhagic fevers are much more likely to cause hemorrhaging before any other fatal infection has a chance to become established. This is because the virus so rapidly and totally metabolizes and consumes all available vitamin C in the bodies of the victims that an advanced stage of scurvy is literally produced after only a few days of the disease.  The scurvy is so complete that the blood vessels generally cannot keep from hemorrhaging long enough to allow an infective complication to develop. In addition  the viral hemorrhagic fevers typically only take hold and reach epidemic proportions in those populations that would already be expected to have low body stores of vitamin C  such as are found in many of the severely malnourished Africans.  In such individuals  an infecting hemorrhagic virus will often wipe out any remaining vitamin C stores before the immune systems can get the upper hand and initiate recovery. When the vitamin C stores are rapidly depleted by large infecting doses of an aggressive virus  the immune system gets similarly depleted and compromised.  ,ebola-76950f92374ade8d7e7f2513673dbe4d61f62965b29c4fe4265a60bb03013d01,0,1424,1,2016-04-18 08:53:48.564279,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1897,Sounds like the Ebola virus puts the body into an acute state of scurvy.

I remembered reading how serious infection radically depletes the body of this vitamin  and about Linus Pauling’s experiments  and about how intravenous vitamin C has saved people when suffering from an overwhelming infective condition. I also thought about how important vitamin C is in the maintenance of the vascular system  and it seemed likely to me that the bleeding caused by Ebola may indeed be caused by this vitamins depletion. As it’s not a harmful treatment  someone who contracted Ebola may be grateful if someone gave it a go – the alternative isn’t great.  ,ebola-85a18c626ac257be536086771cfe24c07eaad262e0f6d819050100623c894a0c,0,670,3,2016-04-18 09:00:31.820981,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,1909,Grant Jacob’s responses are reasonable and expected since no known results of even a test-tube study of IVC (Intravenous Vitamin C) vs. Ebola have ever been published  let alone has there been an RDBPC study.  Jacob’s consideration that “Supplementing what is depleted might contribute to helping patients” is also spot on and deserves considerable esteem. Indeed he is “not medical”  but a recently comprehensive review found only 1/200 patients with an adverse reaction to high-dose IVC (PMC 2898816  PMD 20628650).  And … ebola symptoms are identical with scurvy and there are a number of other reasons suggesting that patients are massively depleted of vitamin C – so mega-supplementation for QOL seems judicious.  ,ebola-85a18c626ac257be536086771cfe24c07eaad262e0f6d819050100623c894a0c,0,719,3,2016-04-18 09:16:31.198800,

This patient was the only one given vitamin C although it is unclear whether she received intravenous high dose vitamin C. What she did receive was a transfusion of blood taken from people who had survived Ebola. So did the other seven people. Only one of the eight died. The doctors noted though that the patients all received good care which also included infusions of glucose and electrolytes  treatment with antibiotic and antimalaria drugs  and food supplementation.  To put that one patient’s survival down to vitamin C is cherry-picking  to say the least.  ,ebola-85a18c626ac257be536086771cfe24c07eaad262e0f6d819050100623c894a0c,0,639,3,2016-04-18 09:18:00.337497,

Dr. Sircus even mentioned that an initial IV dose would be needed. There’s no way a person could orally take as much C as they needed to treat something like Ebola.

Anyway  as high doses of vitamin C are harmless  there is no reason not to give them to Ebola patients.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,2868,The most important item is vitamin C. Humans are not able to manufacture vitamin C. Either we get enough vitamin C from our diet or the immune system will not function optimally and we will be more prone to becoming ill with various infections  Ebola included.   Throughout the medical literature there are many case histories of vitamin C curing viral and other infectious illnesses. Vitamin C activates the immune system so that it can fight any infection. How much vitamin C should you take? I would suggest taking at least 5 000mg of vitamin C on a daily basis. If you become ill with any infectious agent  take more as the body’s requirements dramatically increase when it is confronted with an infectious agent.  Intravenous vitamin C should be given to all Ebola patients. Though it has not been studied  I have no doubt that IV vitamin C would be a great benefit to any patient suffering not only from Ebola but from any infectious agent. In my practice  I have used IV vitamin C for over 20 years. Anytime the body is stressed  vitamin C requirements are elevated.  IV vitamin C achieves a much higher serum level as compared to oral vitamin C. IV vitamin C should be a standard-of-care treatment for all Ebola patients. In fact  it should be standard-of-care for any hospitalized patient.  ,ebola-569a6ef849419fab34784e96278a15849f2b3f5512ac78784863ea8211ba6130,0,1300,3,2016-04-19 12:53:38.838084,

Control of ebola can probably be done with a dose of iv sodium ascorbate of 60 grams in 500 ml of water delivered to the patient every 6 hours. I expect the fever to break in perhaps 4 to 6 hours  if not  then make the dose 120 grams every 6 hours. The vitamin C therapy could be given even if the patient is receiving another therapy. The aim of vitamin C is to strengthen the body faster than ebola weakens it. The vitamin C strengthens the immune system and neutralizes the excess free radicals. This therapy is not tested but it uses safe  available materials.

Fighting infections depletes your vitamin C level  so you need more when you are sick. Sugar also depletes vitamin C. Vitamin C tablets deteriorate over time  so your supply needs to be rotated. Taking large doses at frequent intervals to âbowel toleranceâ (backing off when you get diarrhea) is suggested by some practitioners at the first sign of any illness. Lypo-Spheric vitamin C  available online  is expensive but may be tolerated in higher doses. In fact  it may be combined with tablets  as the two forms may act somewhat differently. This is not mainstream medical advice. There are no good efficacy studies  but it is very unlikely to be harmful.  ,ebola-2d4dc712017ea12c15d63b2892bc4fae78b8d273c0965e285a4e717fcbbee6ec,0,815,3,2016-04-25 12:43:17.808483,

When the vitamin C stores are rapidly depleted by large infecting doses of an aggressive virus  the immune system gets similarly depleted and compromised.  “According to Dr. Thomas Levy  MD  ‘Many viral infectious diseases have been cured and can continue to be cured by the proper administration of Vitamin C. Yes  the vaccinations for these treatable infectious diseases are completely unnecessary when one has the access to proper treatment with vitamin C. And  yes  all the side effects of vaccinations… are also completely unnecessary since the vaccinations do not have to be given in the first place with the availability of properly dosed vitamin C’…”,ebola-384f9dab5b325f4ffa4d537a53697721e3098c924efe0345ce978b60fbe2e209,0,1341,3,2016-04-25 12:51:35.034181,

By invitation of the President of Sierra Leone  he’s going there to teach health care workers how to treat Ebola using ozone.  “I do ozone  ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy  and high-dose vitamin C ” he explains. “All of these collectively belong to a family of therapies called oxidative therapies.  In my opinion – and I’ve been doing them longer than any other living person in North America; since 1986 – especially ozone and ultraviolet [therapies] are among the most powerful therapies for healing across the board of anything I’ve ever seen in my career... It does so by stimulating your own body to heal.”  ,ebola-c7d15895340b3899bba7f783e016a42c8c14a1c89afee546a9e7cc4029e528b4,0,912,4,2016-05-03 11:20:56.405950,

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,126,Vitamin C,8449,The very first symptoms of ebola are exactly the same as scurvy  which is caused by inadequate vitamin C. Though scurvy is seldom fatal as a primary condition  scurvy also represents only a partial deficiency of vitamin C  the body still has a LOT of vitamin C compared to zero  which ebola causes. Absent ANY vitamin C  blood vessels become very weak and start to lose blood  and platelets become ineffective and unable to trigger clots. So death by ebola is caused by massive internal bleeding and loss of blood  which can be stopped simply by taking enormous doses of vitamin C until the immune system succeeds in killing off the virus." ,ebola-a47158fd3190167bb101f49ad6248912affb27cf7d49e253601c8d6627ac37af,0,641,1,2016-05-07 12:24:00.934291,

Is it coincidence that (with the exception of the pigs)  Ebola can infect only species who can’t synthesize the vitamin C? Anyway  as high doses of vitamin C are harmless  there is no reason not to give them to Ebola patients.

1,Ebola,4,assr4,375,Alleged Alternative Treatments for Ebola,168,Melatonin,2410,One important 'off-the-shelf' treatment which I personally have very preliminary evidence to support is high-dose Melatonin.  This would work in a number of ways  but principally through the suppression of IL-1Beta as well as the suppression of the entire constellation of host MMP gene expression. MMP genes dissolve connective tissue (collagen) in the extracellular matrix.  Melatonin suppresses these effects through suppression of IL-1Beta and suppression of MMP genes. These effects of Melatonin have documented peer-reviewed evidence (though not for Ebola specifically)  though Melatonin has been investigated in Phase II trials to suppress inflammation after surgery.   Unfortunately  we do not know what the melatonin dose for Ebola might be (if it works at all)  but the dose is likely to be high (10mg/kg/day or higher).  To complicate matters  the absorption of melatonin is somewhat erratic.     ,ebola-fba46f6233a14acc5f7a110497496f7c2a2cbef150e2cb08e7c45fc8d4d4771f,0,908,3,2016-04-19 08:30:13.836114,

They have alarmed the public unnecessarily.”  Dr Gancz claimed the treatment of frontline staff returning from Sierra Leone was in stark contrast to Public Health England laboratory staff who  he claims  were provided with taxis when they were sent home on Christmas Eve.  Dr Gancz flew out with Miss Cafferkey and another 28 members of the team in November following a ten-day training course at an army base. Half the team  including Miss Cafferkey  were sent to Save the Children's Ebola treatment centre in Kelly Town while Dr Gancz worked at another hospital in Port Loko  where he remains until handing over to a new team.  “,ebola-8484f10d975cecd14a2dfda36a0ca94463e184f33765ded776aef41a11705792,0,1183,4,2016-04-21 12:02:34.741447,
