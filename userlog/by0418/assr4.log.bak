But there are caveats, Kieny said. The panel said ethical criteria must include full transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect of person, preservation of dignity and community involvement.  Because so little is known about safety when these treatments are provided for compassionate use, it’s important to not give false hope to anybody that ebola can be treated now, she said. “This is absolutely not the case. What we rely on now is proper implementation of infection prevention and control.”  Kieny defined compassionate use as access to an unapproved drug outside a clinical trial. There is a moral obligation to collect and share all data generated, she said in the AP video.::43d700df496be912f039f7297ebd0918::ACKNOWLEDGED 43d700df496be912f039f7297ebd0918

It’s not surprising, then, that antivaccinationists have tried to claim that vaccines are responsible for the initial Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. These conspiracy theories have profound effects dealing with health emergencies. In particular, the idea that the CDC is “hiding” something can undermine trust and facilitate the spread of misinformation. That’s just what happened last week.  ::a615f98f4e310d133ce4b2f3f7ef09ed::ACKNOWLEDGED a615f98f4e310d133ce4b2f3f7ef09ed

The conspiracy theory, published in The Event Chronicle, states that the virus does not exist and the US is lying.  The report blames the Red Cross for conspiring along with the United States to steal oil and diamond wealth. It says only those who receive treatments and injections from the Red Cross are getting the disease.  It even goes on to claim it is because of this reason that Liberia and Nigeria kicked the Red Cross out of their countries.  ::eb93a50976d32c0c452537d7bf98dee4::ACKNOWLEDGED eb93a50976d32c0c452537d7bf98dee4

His book, âEmerging Virusesâ denies that Ebola and HIV ânaturally evolvedâ and instead explores the possibility that they were manufactured germs in laboratories which were transmitted to humans via âtaintedâ vaccinations for hepatitis and smallpox. The book talks about the CIAâs possible role in all of this and previous genocides carried out by the government using man-made viruses. Unlike other theorists, however, Horowitz does not jump to the conclusion that the virus was intentionally put into vaccines for the purpose of mass murder andÂ alsoÂ discusses the possibility that the contamination of the vaccination was not intentional.  ::270f6900b6b5be24a86feadb52370b5a::ACKNOWLEDGED 270f6900b6b5be24a86feadb52370b5a

One, the tropical area hosted a plethora of undiscovered exotic diseases that could be exploited for research. Secondly, African people were seen as disposable for biochemical testing.  This is where the genocidal theory of Ebola comes from, particularly for Africans and subsequently Black Americans. Since the Africans were the first to get Ebola and AIDS, they were the first to pass it on.  ::15e08903db40446555355d2939c859b2::ACKNOWLEDGED 15e08903db40446555355d2939c859b2

With unrest in Hong Kong (Umbrella Revolution), Ukraine, the Middle East, Gaza, governments could implement strict anti-contagion policies to revoke rights to public assembly in the interest of public safety.  In fact, this summer the European Union raised its Ebola alert level to âhighâ after Germany admitted Ebola patients into its borders. This coincided with domestic German protests over Israelâs handling of Palestinian aggression in Gaza that left civilians dead on both sides. Anti-Semitic protesters in Germany gathered to protest Israel, much to the chagrin of the German government.  ::17b89cab9fa56bb349ddd75bac5be6ec::ACKNOWLEDGED 17b89cab9fa56bb349ddd75bac5be6ec

Two days ago, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Canadian Press that it’s “quite conceivable, if not likely” that fast-tracked Ebola vaccines may have to given to entire countries to get the viral outbreak under control (via Modern Healthcare):  “It is conceivable that this epidemic will not turn around even if we pour resources into it. It may just keep going and going and it might require avaccine.”  “As the epidemic gets more and more formidable and in some cases out of control it is quite conceivable, if not likely, that we may need to deploy the vaccine to the entire country to be able to shut the epidemic down. That is clearly a possibility.” [emphasis added]  The article did not specify which country in particular Dr. Fauci — whose institute just sohappens to be currently working on an experimental Ebola vaccine (the first to begin human clinical trials) with Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline — was referring to. Was he talking specifically about Sierra Leone? Liberia? Guinea? Any place where Ebola has taken hold? The entire continent of Africa? Other countries, should it break out there includingSpain or America?  ::569213be0740dacd0647e0572f7c55ae::ACKNOWLEDGED 569213be0740dacd0647e0572f7c55ae

If we apply Gates’ penchant for investing in causes which produce a hefty “return on investment” (ROI) then one could reasonably suspect that Gates is positioning himself to profit on the $50 million he has invested in the Ebola cause which conveniently includes the CDC, the holder of the patent for Ebola.The NIH presently holds all patents on Ebola vaccines.

Interestingly, Bill Gates has donated a total of $560 million dollars to the Global Fund. The Global Fund has also positioned themselves to be in charge of the distribution of the “newly developed”, and not yet announced vaccines for TB and HIV.  Since the goal is the vaccination of every man, woman and child on the planet with multiple vaccines, Gates’ $560 million contribution to the Global Fund is chump change compared to the expected ROI. However, on deck is the Ebola virus.  I was also told by my sources that the polio vaccine will be a part of the vaccination cocktail. When I asked how many vaccines are we talking about, I was told as many as two dozen vaccines will be required and forcibly administered by various levels of government. The easiest place to enforce the mandatory vaccines will be through the schools and it will include all schools, both public and private. My sources told me about pending and recently passed legislation in several states which are requiring mandatory vaccinations. In the brief time I have had to process this information, I have found enough confirming information to publish the fact that this undeniably true.     ::f1c8d8359edc01da399b29a983ff148e::ACKNOWLEDGED f1c8d8359edc01da399b29a983ff148e

And shockingly, that point is relevant to the Ebola vaccine, because as yet I have seen no evidence that Ebola virus has ever been properly identified in any human being.  Therefore, there is no evidence anyone needs protection from the virus.  As I reported several days ago [2], chemist David Rasnick, PhD, has examined published literature on Ebola, and has concluded:  “I have examined in detail the literature on isolation and EMs [EM: electron microscope pictures] of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. I have not found any convincing evidence that Ebola virus (and for that matter Marburg) has been isolated from humans. There is certainly no confirmatory evidence of human isolation.”  Therefore, the need for an Ebola vaccine (even if you believe in the theory of vaccination) is completely unproven.  ::8c565f47d3c93db68d448b8fff7b4d2c::ACKNOWLEDGED 8c565f47d3c93db68d448b8fff7b4d2c
