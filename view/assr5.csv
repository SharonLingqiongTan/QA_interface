The bodies they receive from the case management centre are completely disinfected in advance  do not contain any trace of Ebola  and are therefore safe to handle without the full protective gear. “The family is contacted to determine where they would like their loved one buried  back in their community or in one of the newly dug gravesites here in Kailahun town  created just for Ebola victims ” says James. “We are finding that most don’t want their relatives returned  they are still so scared that the bodies are contagious.”  The second type of burial is more complicated and risky  as it involves the Red Cross dead body management team going into a community and preparing the body for burial.
