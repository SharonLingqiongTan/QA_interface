This is largest Ebola epidemic ever recorded, yet theÂ violence perpetrated by Islamist radicals, Boko Haram, and government troops in Nigeria has claimed more than 10,340 lives in just 12 months, according to new figures by the Council on Foreign Relations.Â In that period around the same number of civilians, 10,733, were violently killed in Iraq by ISIS, according to the United Nations.Â The conflict has displaced at least 1.5 million people, while more than 2,000 were killed last year and Boko Haram’sÂ territory now nearly equals the Islamic Stateâs in Iraq and Syria.::1b5d1a6f98c71bdf211c607c2e19523e::ACKNOWLEDGED 1b5d1a6f98c71bdf211c607c2e19523e
