In Islam  death is handled much differently.  Relatives personally wash the corpses of loved ones from head to toe. Often  several family members participate in this posthumous bathing ritual  known as Ghusl.  Before scrubbing the skin with soap and water  family members press down on the abdomen to excrete fluids still in the body. A mixture of camphor and water is used for a final washing. Then  family members dry off the body and shroud it in white linens.  Again  washing the bodies of the dead in this way is considered a collective duty for Muslims  especially in Muslim nations. Failure to do so is believed to leave the deceased “impure” and jeopardizes the faithful’s ascension into Paradise (unless he died in jihad; then no Ghusl is required).  Before the body is buried  Muslims attending the funeral typically pass a common bowl for use in ablution or washing of the face  feet and hands  compounding the risk of infection.  ,ebola-d825bd192bae3670670e9bd6535b7985342d99c68e55f6ea55ceb7db79b59e99,0,1045,4,2016-04-21 11:45:00.149756,

In May of this year  the chief physician of the Lassa program  Sheik Humarr Khan  was watching out for Ebola  which  like Lassa  is a Level 4 pathogen. The virus had been spreading in Guinea and Liberia  but there had been no reported cases yet in Sierra Leone.  ,ebola-bb585f5d0242499b34a6bc5a4c5fed4dfe9aa0aadba5c5ec5ad3d18d5ab7cfb3,0,265,3,2016-05-01 19:23:08.776741, 
1,Ebola,6,assr6,418,Kenema,274,Dr. Sheik Umar Khan,6613,Khan was a specialist in viral hemorrhagic diseases and one of the worldâs leading experts in Lassa fever  and people described him as voluble and intense; virus experts from a number of American research institutions had developed close friendships with him and his staff. He devoted much of his time to tending patients at the hospital  who were typically poor. Quite a few of them couldnât afford to buy medicine  so Khan bought it for them  and he gave them food if they looked hungry. âYou must eat or you cannot get better â he told them.  Cartoon â,ebola-bb585f5d0242499b34a6bc5a4c5fed4dfe9aa0aadba5c5ec5ad3d18d5ab7cfb3,3,561,3,2016-05-01 19:26:02.765945,

1,Ebola,6,assr6,418,Kenema,274,Dr. Sheik Umar Khan,6621,On July 19th  at a large staff meeting  people noticed that Khan didnât look well. The next day  he didnât come to work. He had isolated himself at home. The following morning  he requested a test. One of the lab technicians went to his house to draw blood: it was positive for Ebola. Khan didnât want to be treated at Kenema  because he didnât want his staff to see him develop symptoms  and he felt that his presence would further demoralize them. The next day  he climbed into an ambulance  which carried him along rutted dirt roads to the Ebola ward in Kailahun,ebola-bb585f5d0242499b34a6bc5a4c5fed4dfe9aa0aadba5c5ec5ad3d18d5ab7cfb3,0,573,3,2016-05-01 20:05:28.117483, 
1,Ebola,6,assr6,418,Kenema,274,Dr. Sheik Umar Khan,6623,The government of Sierra Leone regarded Humarr Khanâs plight as a national crisis. As soon as Khan became ill  a government official sent out an e-mail to Ebola experts around the world  asking for information about any drug or vaccine that might help him. In a series of international conference calls  officials from the World Health Organization  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the government of Sierra Leone  the Public Health Agency of Canada  scientists from the United States Army  and health workers from Doctors Without Borders  which was running the Kailahun Ebola center  debated how to treat Khan. Many of the people on the phone knew him  and this was a matter of life and death.  The debate quickly centered on ZMapp  which seemed to show more promise than other drugs. Why should Khan  and not other patients  get any experimental drug? What if he died? ZMapp had been tested in some monkeys a few months earlier  but what was the significance of that? It was made from mouse-human antibodies that had been grown in tobacco plants. If such substances enter the bloodstream  a person might have a severe allergic reaction. If something went wrong with the drug  there was no intensive-care unit in Kailahun. The population of Sierra Leone would be furious if the West was seen to have killed Khan  an African scientist and a national hero  with an experimental drug. But if he wasnât given the ZMapp  and he died  people might say that the West had withheld a miracle drug from him. âI was making sure my tone of voice stayed neutral â Kobinger recalled. The debate and the calls went on for three days.  ,ebola-bb585f5d0242499b34a6bc5a4c5fed4dfe9aa0aadba5c5ec5ad3d18d5ab7cfb3,0,1649,3,2016-05-01 20:13:09.365547,

1,Ebola,6,assr6,418,Kenema,277,Mad Scientist rumors,6581,I don’t think those tests were true. We all know that the Kenema Government Hospital lab was only equipped for well-known hemorrhagic fever tests with special emphasis on Lassa fever  typhoid and malaria which are common in the country. It’s therefore logical why the lab had no Ebola test equipment.  This is simply because Ebola remained an unknown sickness in the entire West Africa till December last year when it broke out in some remote villages in neighboring Guinea. So our health department couldn’t have installed an Ebola test lab in Kenema prior to the outbreak  except otherwise the outbreak was premeditated.  Even the health workers didn’t have any knowledge about Ebola  which is why a lot of them succumbed to it at the initial stage.   Can’t you sense the rapid decrement in the number of new cases detected after the arrival of true Ebola test equipment and professional medics?  I don’t even think there is any decrement in the disease; I think the arrival of foreign experts with (true) test equipment has enabled the labs to distinguish Ebola from malaria and typhoid.  I also believe that those who really contracted Ebola have died and the survivor stories are manmade. Perhaps the actual figure is even 3 times more than the official figures.  ,ebola-78e263002b2acb2f9f9df7b32d9f06438e6b8cb5338b5a1d885da8b29cc6f878,0,1269,3,2016-04-30 19:13:53.877627,

1,Ebola,6,assr6,418,Kenema,281,Discredit rumors,6513,We wanted to set the record straight.  Soros and Gates  There’s no proof of Soros and Gates funding a bioweapons lab in Kenema  one of the largest cities in Sierra Leone with a population of about 150 000. And there’s really no case that a bioweapons lab in Kenema is behind the outbreak.  "The assertion is absurd " said Chris Williams  spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation did provide a $1 million Ebola-related grant to support emergency efforts in West Africa by UNICEF  he said.  A spokeswoman for Soros’ Open Society Foundations also said it does not fund any labs  much less a bioweapons lab  in West Africa.  ,ebola-b2ded52f400d485f6478d18865b45ba80fefa969d3f1fad4f000a79047ad0874,0,654,4,2016-04-29 20:33:51.519364,

1,Ebola,6,assr6,418,Kenema,285,ZMapp debate,6622,The government of Sierra Leone regarded Humarr Khanâs plight as a national crisis. As soon as Khan became ill  a government official sent out an e-mail to Ebola experts around the world  asking for information about any drug or vaccine that might help him. In a series of international conference calls  officials from the World Health Organization  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the government of Sierra Leone  the Public Health Agency of Canada  scientists from the United States Army  and health workers from Doctors Without Borders  which was running the Kailahun Ebola center  debated how to treat Khan. Many of the people on the phone knew him  and this was a matter of life and death.  The debate quickly centered on ZMapp  which seemed to show more promise than other drugs. Why should Khan  and not other patients  get any experimental drug? What if he died? ZMapp had been tested in some monkeys a few months earlier  but what was the significance of that? It was made from mouse-human antibodies that had been grown in tobacco plants. If such substances enter the bloodstream  a person might have a severe allergic reaction. If something went wrong with the drug  there was no intensive-care unit in Kailahun. The population of Sierra Leone would be furious if the West was seen to have killed Khan  an African scientist and a national hero  with an experimental drug. But if he wasnât given the ZMapp  and he died  people might say that the West had withheld a miracle drug from him. âI was making sure my tone of voice stayed neutral â Kobinger recalled. The debate and the calls went on for three days.  ,ebola-bb585f5d0242499b34a6bc5a4c5fed4dfe9aa0aadba5c5ec5ad3d18d5ab7cfb3,0,1649,3,2016-05-01 20:12:47.336282,
