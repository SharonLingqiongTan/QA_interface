UHC's commission based claims reviewer  Sven Tweeny  CNA  has  recommended 24 hours of observation care instead. "If we paid inpatient for every viral syndrome  we'd run out of money before New Year's Eve."  Attending physician Dr. Frank Johnstick  was informed of the decision during a  physician-to-CNA courtesy briefing.   "That doesn't surprise me. We've been battling Dekalb United CNAs for years."  Ebola virus causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever  an often fatal disease. Despite the high risk of complications associated with this deadly infection  there are no treatment options available.  Say's Dr. Johnstick  "His creatinine jumped from one to six overnight  but he's still making urine so they ain't budging on obs[ervation].  And his hemoglobin dropped seven grams in less than 24 hours.  You'd think that would get him inpatient  right?  Nope.  It just gave me mangina."  Utilization review expert Fran Lotran agreed with UnitedHealthCares' decision.  "That patient traveled thousands of miles to be isolated and observed.  If those people want inpatient  they're going to have to cut something off above the wrist or knee  create a life threatening medical error or order every four hour neuro checks and blood cultures."  Shortly after the decision to deny inpatient status  Dr. Brantley's wife was seen frantically booking an airline flight back home to pick up her husband's prescription strength Allegra and Prilosec.  Hospital officials informed Dr. and Mrs. Brantley that a one week supply of home medications not covered by UHC and provided by the hospital under observation status would cost $12 000.  Shortly after this discussion  Dr.Brantley was diagnosed with a heart attack and approved for another 24 hours of observation by UnitedHealthCares of Dekalb County.
