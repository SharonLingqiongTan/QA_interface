After outbreaks in Uganda in the late 1990âs, scientists tested the blood of several people who were in close contact with Ebola patients, and found a number of them had markers in their blood indicating they carried the disease, but they were totally asymptomaticâthey managed to completely avoid the horrifying symptoms of the disease.  ::7a2c9deb19b97ade31ceab77c567c85d::ACKNOWLEDGED 7a2c9deb19b97ade31ceab77c567c85d

And if the effect such immunity can be confirmed, say the authors, it could have a significant impact on projections of how widely Ebola will spread. It could also help contain the outbreak.  They urge public health authorities to carry out a prompt investigation to establish how commonplace such immunity to Ebola might be. How many people have been infected without developing symptoms or spreading the disease? And are they likely to be protected from future outbreaks?  ::19410838578f026d83ece3172464d7fd::ACKNOWLEDGED 19410838578f026d83ece3172464d7fd

"We found a striking activation of both B and T cells in all four patients," wrote lead study author Dr. Anita McElroy, an infectious disease researcher at Emory.  McElroy and her colleagues found that immature B cells, or plasmablasts, that were actively secreting antibody accounted for 50% of all B cells in infected individuals, compared with less than 1% in healthy individuals.  Likewise, the frequency of activated CD4 T cells -- white blood cells that help direct immune cell response -- ranged from 5% to 30% in the patients, compared with 1% to 2% in healthy individuals.  ::3f38305b0a4cc2611b0b68970d69595f::ACKNOWLEDGED 3f38305b0a4cc2611b0b68970d69595f

Antibodies to the virus were found in 15.3% of rural communities, whereas these people had never had haemorrhagic fever or other specific symptoms of the disease (such as severe diarrhoea or vomiting). IRD researchers and their partners1 recently discovered this large number of healthy carriers among Gabonese people, even in areas where there has never been an Ebola outbreak. The scientists consider that these people have somehow come into contact with the virus, probably present in fruit contaminated by saliva from Chiroptera (fruit bats)2.  ::25e698ed665870673f128685d4f6e262::ACKNOWLEDGED 25e698ed665870673f128685d4f6e262

This part of immunity keeps a virus from quickly reproducing inside cells.  To trigger an effective, early response to viral infection, interferons must pass on their signal to other cells. This occurs through other messengers inside cells as part of interferon signaling pathways, with the last of these messengers turning on genes inside the nuclei of cells to drive the immune response.    ::8b9cde51e5665bb1622c631ae2794ce9::ACKNOWLEDGED 8b9cde51e5665bb1622c631ae2794ce9

These individuals can either be hetero or homozygous for the mutation, conferring greater protection with two copies. It's the same mutation that protects against Smallpox and HIV, though not 100%. Contrary to some articles, this is not a particularly good mutation as the normal (external) receptor has immunity jobs that aren't carried out with the receptor inside the cell. There has been some talk of Black Plague being the cause of the selection pressure, but some newer analysis has shown numerically that it was probably the 1000+ years of Smallpox that conferred the mutation. This is perhaps why the alleged cures in Africa too place, from using the HIV drugs. Those drugs were likely CCR5 antagonists and virus was unable to enter the T-cell and replicate. The idea with the Africans is that there is probably some European genetics in those with ancestors who came from America after the Civil War. Thoughts?

This is perhaps because of some unknown genetic advantage, reports The New York Times.  "It's fair to say that some people are immune," said Robert F. Garry Jr., a Tulane University expert in hemorrhagic fevers who works in Sierra Leone.  In 2000, Dr. Leroy's team studied 24 Gabonese who had tended victims without ever falling ill. Eleven had not just antibodies but remnants of virus and markers of inflammation in their blood. They had clearly been infected and defeated the virus on their own.  "But we don't know if it's one percent, two percent or twenty percent."  There are about 1,800 survivors of the current West African outbreak, all of whom are now immune. But there may be many thousands more.  Determining the overall level of immunity in West Africa would require testing thousands of blood samples, an impossible task in the current conditions.  This knowledge could be a great help in fighting the current outbreak. Immune individuals could safely tend the sick and bury the dead just as smallpox survivors did in the centuries before smallpox vaccine. Also, scientist could harvest antibodies from their blood to treat new Ebola victims.  But many factors remain unclear, including which Africans have antibodies and how much antibody is needed to be protective.  The biggest mystery is how the immunity arose. It is possible that some get low doses of virus and become "vaccinated" by eating infected monkeys, bats that are undercooked, or fruit contaminated with bat saliva.  ::5b7af7a0fbc03cb50bd4f93f61567bb5::ACKNOWLEDGED 5b7af7a0fbc03cb50bd4f93f61567bb5

Still, she added, “there is really no scientific evidence.”  The survival rate during this outbreak is about 30 percent, according to the WHO. Immunity may stem from antibodies produced by the immune system to help people survive the disease in the first place. The antibodies are then primed to aggressively fight off any future threat from the same virus.  ::d44eeb627d1fbd8b7ba8c12c23c2e6db::ACKNOWLEDGED d44eeb627d1fbd8b7ba8c12c23c2e6db

And if the effect such immunity can be confirmed, say the authors, it could have a significant impact on projections of how widely Ebola will spread. It could also help contain the outbreak.  ::68e77d746c7e367aac80313eba261bbd::ACKNOWLEDGED 68e77d746c7e367aac80313eba261bbd

However, new research published Monday in the journal PNAS suggests that the human immune system doesn't give up that easily when confronted with Ebola virus disease.  In tests performed on the four Ebola patients treated at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, doctors discovered that each of the patients' immune systems had mounted a surprisingly strong counterattack.

Using a cell culture model for Ebola virus infection, they have discovered that the virus disables a cellular protein called tetherin that normally can block the spread of virus from cell to cell. "Tetherin represents a new class of cellular factors that possess a very different means of inhibiting viral replication," says study author Paul Bates, PhD, Associate Professor of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. "Tetherin is the first example of a protein that affects the virus replication cycle after the virus is fully made and prevents the virus from being able to go off and infect the next cell." These findings appear online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  When a cell is infected with a virus like Ebola, which is deadly to 90 percent of people infected, the cell is pirated by the virus and turned into a production factory that makes massive quantities on new virions. These virions are then released from that cell to infect other cells and promote the spreading infection.  Tetherin is one of the immune system's responses to a viral infection. If working properly, tetherin stops the infected cell from releasing the newly made virus, thus shutting down spread to other cells. However, this study shows that the Ebola virus has developed a way to disable tetherin, thus blocking the body's response and allowing the virus to spread.

The team further showed that CD8 T cells are the major source of cytokines in response to acute Ebola infection. Moreover, in the absence of anti-Ebola antibodies, so-called memory CD8 T cells can apparently stave off infection. The researchers hope to understand the mechanism of this immune protection through further research.::c3c0e91a6d9d30448838a87f1f1696ac::ACKNOWLEDGED c3c0e91a6d9d30448838a87f1f1696ac

"We've known for a long time that infection with Ebola obstructs an important immune compound called interferon," said Amarasinghe. "Now we know how Ebola does this, and that can guide the development of new treatments."  According to the researchers, VP24 works by preventing the transcription factor STAT1, which carries interferon's antiviral message, from entering the nucleus and initiating an immune response. As part of a rapid immune response, the cell allows STAT1 an "emergency access lane" to the nucleus. Rather than block all nuclear transfer, however, VP24 focuses on blocking STAT1's "emergency access lane."  "::f5904690eb773ca11e10aae53297bc20::ACKNOWLEDGED f5904690eb773ca11e10aae53297bc20

In general, patients who have recovered from Ebola virus infection do develop a very robust immunity to the virus. They develop antibodies against the virus and they also develop cell-mediated immunity—the lymphocytes important to form viral control of pathogens. In general, the finding is it’s basically like being immunized—it would be unusual to get infection with the same strain.   Will that immunity afford them protection against other strains of Ebola? We are still evaluating that in our two patients. Cross-protection is not quite as robust. There are five strains of Ebola viruses. Even though that data is not great, the feeling is there is potential for being infected if you go to a different part of Africa and get exposed to a different strain.   ::f79857b97875426f43a60fbb8a999b04::ACKNOWLEDGED f79857b97875426f43a60fbb8a999b04

Assuming they are correct, and if those people can be identified, they could be a great help in fighting the outbreak. Immune persons could safely tend the sick and bury the dead just as smallpox survivors did in the centuries before smallpox vaccine.::2073feb8390769b83710d89776bed10b::ACKNOWLEDGED 2073feb8390769b83710d89776bed10b

Nineteen percent of the mice were unfazed. They not only survived, but also fully regained their lost weight within two weeks. They had no gross pathological evidence of disease. Their livers looked normal.  Eleven percent were partially resistant and less than half of these died. Seventy percent of the mice had a greater than 50 percent mortality. Nineteen percent of this last group had liver inflammation without classic symptoms of Ebola, and thirty-four percent had blood that took too long to clot, a hallmark of fatal Ebola hemorrhagic fever in humans. Those mice also had internal bleeding, swollen spleens and changes in liver color and texture.::931fdc97030ffcde9bd3768f6e90fd47::ACKNOWLEDGED 931fdc97030ffcde9bd3768f6e90fd47

A vaccine given to a physician who experienced an accidental needle stick in an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone produced a strong early immune response, according to a new case report.  The exposed individual was vaccinated 43 hours after the needle stick and was transported by jet to the National Institutes of Health Special Clinical Studies Unit in Maryland.  “Until there is an effective preventive vaccine against Ebola virus, having a treatment or vaccine to offer an exposed health care worker is an important goal,” says Mark Mulligan, executive director of the Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center and corresponding author of the paper that is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  ::796dddf313bfb726fd29733a255af38e::ACKNOWLEDGED 796dddf313bfb726fd29733a255af38e

Photo by Jack Kearse.  President Barack Obama met with Ebola experts from Emory Healthcare as part of his Sept. 16 visit to the federal Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.  Obama visited the Atlanta-based CDC for an update on the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa and the U.S. response to it. The president met with Emory University Hospital physicians, nurses and others involved with the treatment of Ebola patients here before giving an address where he announced a significant expansion of U.S. efforts to combat the disease.  "Faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to us, the United States, and it's a responsibility that we embrace," Obama said. "We are prepared to take leadership on this, to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has, and to mobilize the world in ways that only America can do."  The president's meetings with the Emory Healthcare team were closed to the press, but he discussed Emory's efforts in his public remarks after stressing that while "the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low," the administration is taking steps to make sure that American hospitals are prepared to identify and treat the virus.  "Here I have got to commend everybody at Emory University Hospital," Obama said. "I just had the opportunity to meet with Doctors Gartland and Ribner and members of their team and the nurses who — sorry doctors, but having been in hospitals, I know they are the ones really doing the work — and I had a chance to thank them for their extraordinary efforts in helping to provide care for the first Americans who recently contracted the disease in Africa.  ::1896b295a00da90a9854a6f158570c33::ACKNOWLEDGED d4180ff28401d41e763afc0e4a501ab8

U.  |  passage_id: 996  |  passage_name:  EMORY (US) â The Ebola virus uses a protein decoy to undermine and evade the immune response of its infected host, new research shows.  Ebola virus is the causative agent of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF), a disease with up to 90 percent mortality. While human outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have been confined to Africa, Ebola virus infections in bats, the presumed natural reservoir of the virus, have also been detected in Europe and Asia. Ebola virus infection has also been reported in domestic pigs in Southeast Asia.  The high lethality of the disease, combined with its short incubation period and the lack of vaccines or effective treatments, makes Ebola virus a significant public health threat as well as a potentially devastating biological weapon.  Efforts to develop a vaccine against Ebola virus have met with limited success, and it is likely that the virus employs complex immune evasion mechanisms that present unique challenges for vaccine design. Understanding these evasion mechanisms is a critical first step in developing an effective vaccine.  In this study, published in PLoS Pathogens, the authors examined the role of a protein secreted in large quantities by Ebola virus-infected cells. The protein shares regions with a membrane protein that the virus expresses on its surface and uses to initiate the infection process.

U.  |  passage_id: 998  |  passage_name:  Emory Healthcare has launched an external website that will serve as a resource for health care organizations regarding best practices for safe and effective screening, diagnosis and treatment for patients with Ebola virus disease.  The new website, with the ability to freely download information, is publicly available at: www.emoryhealthcare.org/ebolaprep.  The Emory Healthcare Ebola Preparedness Protocols website includes policies, procedures and protocols developed within Emory Healthcare to enable physicians and staff to deal safely and effectively with various risk categories of patients who could be or are infected with the Ebola virus. The website will be updated as more information is available.  “Health care providers throughout the United States are very concerned about the potential spread of Ebola virus and the possible arrival of patients with Ebola virus disease at their emergency departments, hospitals and clinics,” says John Fox, President and CEO of Emory Healthcare.  “We fully acknowledge the risk factors that make this area of health care very challenging for any organization. However, we firmly believe that all of American health care needs some level of preparedness for Ebola and other types of communicable diseases that can always impact us at any point. Emory Healthcare is committed to sharing our processes and experience on how to provide safe, effective care for patients with Ebola virus disease.  The website provides guidance on initial screening of patients at all entry points into hospitals and clinics, as well as detailed protocols including confirmation of diagnosis, treatment, waste management, clinical laboratories, advanced supportive care, potential complications and discharge. The website also includes a detailed description of the components and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), correct methods of donning and doffing, and proper disposal of PPE.  ::cbd55940a83ad43ee121e4de4236b63c::ACKNOWLEDGED cbd55940a83ad43ee121e4de4236b63c

U  |  passage_id: 999  |  passage_name:  A Dallas nurse who is being treated for the deadly Ebola virus got some good news Wednesday, when blood tests returned negative for the virus that has killed more than 4,800 people worldwide, her family said.  The test results donât mean that Amber Vinson, 29, is leaving Emory University Hospital in Atlanta anytime soon, or that she is Ebola-free, a source with knowledge of her case told NBC News.  âAmber and our family are ecstatic to receive this latest report on her condition,” Vinsonâs mother, Debra Berry, said in a statement. âWe all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home.”  Emory University Hospital declined to comment.  Vinson was diagnosed with Ebola on Oct. 15, a week after the patient she cared for, Thomas Eric Duncan died from the disease at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Another nurse who was diagnosed with Ebola after caring for Duncan, Nina Pham, is being treated at a National Institutes of Health medical center and is in good condition, the NIH said.  ::e35c3ca10d1fa497dc18cbb23a1ac6f3::ACKNOWLEDGED e35c3ca10d1fa497dc18cbb23a1ac6f3

Nancy Writebol was discharged from the Emory University Hospital on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2014, and Kent Brantly, MD, was discharged today, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2014.  “After a rigorous and successful course of treatment and testing, the Emory Healthcare team has determined that both patients have recovered from the Ebola virus and can return to their families and community without concern for spreading this infection to others,” says Bruce Ribner, MD, medical director of the Emory University Hospital Communicable Disease Containment Unit.  Criteria for the discharge of both patients were based on standard infectious disease protocols and blood and urine diagnostic tests. Our team has maintained its extensive safety procedures throughout this treatment process and is confident that the discharge of these patients poses no public health threat.  “The Emory Healthcare team is extremely pleased with Dr. Brantly’s and Mrs. Writebol’s recovery, and was inspired by their spirit and strength, as well as by the steadfast support of their families,” says Ribner.  The mission of Emory University Hospital is to heal and to advance knowledge. The team of health care professionals who cared for these Ebola patients has trained for years to treat and contain the most dangerous infectious diseases in the world. The experience, understanding and learning that Emory’s medical professionals have gained during this process will be applied, not only to Ebola, but to other emergent diseases that the world may confront in the future.  ::6784fb4bca7ff9394a1ed3de74c6fc96::ACKNOWLEDGED 6784fb4bca7ff9394a1ed3de74c6fc96

Health officials are monitoring 48 others who had some contact with Duncan before he was admitted the hospital, where he died Oct. 8.  Pham, 26, became the first person to contract the disease on U.S. soil as she cared for Duncan. The nurse released a statement Tuesday through Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital saying she was "doing well," and the hospital listed her in good condition.  She has received a plasma transfusion from a doctor who beat the virus and the hospital CEO said medical staff members remain hopeful about her condition.  Pham was in Duncan's room often, from the day he was placed in intensive care until the day before he died.  "I'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers," she said.  ::3edd2c38eaeeec63037fe6a5ce0fd1b7::ACKNOWLEDGED 3edd2c38eaeeec63037fe6a5ce0fd1b7

Deal defended his decision to appoint an Ebola response team headed up by Georgia Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald.   “Every hospital in Georgia will identify and isolate, and then there will be designated treatment hospitals where the treatment will occur,” Fitzgerald said.

After a long flight from the west African country of Liberia, Nancy Writebol landed at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Cobb County just before 11:30 a.m. Tuesday and was quickly transferred to Emory University Hospital for treatment.  From NewsChopper 2, Writebol could be seen being taken out of the ambulance on a stretcher and was dressed in a special suit so she wouldn’t spread the virus.  There, Writebol will join Dr. Kent Brantly in an isolated area of the hospital to be treated for the deadly virus.  Writebol and Brantly were both working for SIM, an international Christian organization that has been in Liberia working with those affected by the Ebola outbreak.  SIM USA president Bruce Johnson spoke at a news conference Tuesday afternoon to give an update on Writebol’s condition.  Johnson said he spoke to Writebol’s husband David earlier in the day who said Nancy had shown signs of improvement before leaving Liberia.

U  |  passage_id: 1203  |  passage_name:  The answer, experts say, is because Emory University Hospital is one of the safest places in the world to treat someone with Ebola. There's virtually no chance the virus can spread from the hospital's super-secure isolation unit.  And another thing, they say: medical workers risking their lives overseas deserve the best treatment they can get.  Dr. Kent Brantly became the first person infected with Ebola to be brought to the United States from Africa. He arrived Saturday at one of the nation's best hospitals. Fellow aid worker Nancy Writebol was expected to arrive in several days.  Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC on Sunday that Brantly's condition seems to have improved and that it was encouraging to see Brantly walk out of the ambulance unassisted when he arrived at the hospital.  Frieden said he understands the public's concerns about Ebola, and the public health role is to ensure that the infection is not spread.

U  |  passage_id: 1206  |  passage_name:  In the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa, whose death toll is approaching 10,000, little information has been available about how the human immune response unfolds after infection.  Researchers from Emory and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now obtained a first look at the immune responses in four Ebola virus disease survivors who received care at Emory University Hospital in 2014, by closely examining their T cells and B cells during the acute phase of the disease. The findings reveal surprisingly high levels of immune activation, and have implications for the current effort to develop vaccines against Ebola.  All four patients' immune systems showed strong signs of T and B cell activation, according to a paper published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Some previous research on Ebola virus disease had suggested that immune responses could be impaired.  "Our findings counter the idea that Ebola virus infection is immunosuppressive, at least in the patients that we were able to study," says lead author Anita McElroy, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics (infectious disease) at Emory University School of Medicine and a guest researcher at CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch. "They also demonstrate the value that supportive care may have in enabling the immune system to fight back against Ebola virus infection."  The paper emerged from a collaboration between immunologists at Emory Vaccine Center led by Rafi Ahmed, PhD, Aneesh Mehta, MD and Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit team, and investigators from CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch, led by Christina Spiropoulou, PhD. Researchers from La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology contributed to the paper.  "::a7bdf2e06322b15ec5aaea5ea56be337::ACKNOWLEDGED a7bdf2e06322b15ec5aaea5ea56be337

The co-first authors of the JAMA paper are Lilin Lai, MD from Emory's Department of Medicine and Richard Davey, MD, from the NIH Clinical Studies Unit.  A clinical trial testing the ability of this experimental vaccine to prevent Ebola disease recently began in West Africa. The vaccine was developed by Public Health Agency Canada and NewLink Genetics, Inc and has been licensed to Merck.

U  |  passage_id: 1209  |  passage_name:  In a study published in PLoS Pathogens, researchers at Emory University have discovered a potentially important mechanism by which the Ebola virus alters and evades the immune response of its infected host.  Ebola virus is the causative agent of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF), a disease with up to 90 percent mortality. While human outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have been confined to Africa, Ebola virus infections in bats, the presumed natural reservoir of the virus, have also been detected in Europe and Asia. Ebola virus infection has also been reported in domestic pigs in Southeast Asia.   The high lethality of the disease, combined with its short incubation period and the lack of vaccines or effective treatments, makes Ebola virus a significant public health threat as well as a potentially devastating biological weapon.   Efforts to develop a vaccine against Ebola virus have met with limited success, and it is likely that the virus employs complex immune evasion mechanisms that present unique challenges for vaccine design. Understanding these evasion mechanisms is a critical first step in developing an effective vaccine.  ::3bb1efd0d554e042e555e4e7e918ed54::ACKNOWLEDGED 3bb1efd0d554e042e555e4e7e918ed54

Leaders from several Georgia universities (Emory, UGA, Mercer), the head of the state's National Guard, and Atlanta's top operations and airport officials were among the members named to the group.  After the debate last night, Deal said the group's formation was the "culmination" of efforts by state officials, who had already notified Georgia's first responders and police officers about guidelines for coming into contact with a potentially infected person, to prepare for a possible Ebola outbreak. When asked about implementing a travel ban to Ebola-stricken countries, Deal said implementing one would make "a lot of common sense," but noted that it's a policy decision made at the federal level.

Last month aid workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were successfully treated and released from Emory.  ::f24fc7033b021c5b99eb9d5aa79f3e24::ACKNOWLEDGED f24fc7033b021c5b99eb9d5aa79f3e24

U.  |  passage_id: 1305  |  passage_name:  Photos of the patient arriving show the person was able to walk out of the ambulance with some assistance.  Dr. Aneesh Mehta, who’s one of the five doctors treating the patient, said the ability to walk is a good sign, but it’s only one measure of the patient’s health.  "As we know, the situation with Ebola can be dynamic; it can change,” Mehta said, “and so we will do our continuous assessments of this patient to make sure that we’re interjecting wherever we can to improve his overall care."  Neither Emory nor the State Department is releasing any information about the latest aid worker, citing patient confidentiality, though Mehta did refer to the patient as “he.”  “The patient is being assessed at this time,” he said, “and we’ll try to develop a good plan for the patient that’s specific to his needs.”  The World Health Organization Monday said a doctor in Sierra Leone had tested positive for the disease and was being evacuated, though it’s still unclear whether the person now being treated at Emory is the doctor in question.  Mehta said the hospital is looking at all possible treatments for the patient, including any experimental drugs that might be available.  ::3d05db6d13c203e8ef137dcc62a6d5ac::ACKNOWLEDGED 3d05db6d13c203e8ef137dcc62a6d5ac

U.  |  passage_id: 1324  |  passage_name:  CHICAGO - After successfully treating four Ebola patients last year, Emory University in Atlanta is now leading a government-funded project that will use blood from survivors of the deadly virus to test a novel way of treating infectious disease.  Traditional vaccines boost the immune system's response to infections. The new project will inject people with genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, in hopes of spurring a person's own cells to make specific antibodies capable of fighting Ebola or other pathogens. "The person's body is the factory," said Dr. James Crowe of Vanderbilt University, one of the collaborators on the project."It's a cool idea." Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria.  Antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases, tobacco plants, such as Mapp Biopharmaceutical's experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp.  ::7759d361c18e9f1c3abcb197d04c69f4::ACKNOWLEDGED 7759d361c18e9f1c3abcb197d04c69f4

U.  |  passage_id: 1381  |  passage_name:  CHICAGO - After successfully treating four Ebola patients last year, Emory University in Atlanta is now leading a government-funded project that will use blood from survivors of the deadly virus to test a novel way of treating infectious disease.   Traditional vaccines boost the immune system’s response to infections. The new project will inject people with genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, in hopes of spurring a person’s own cells to make specific antibodies capable of fighting Ebola or other pathogens. “The person’s body is the factory,” said Dr James Crowe of Vanderbilt University, one of the collaborators on the project. “It’s a cool idea.” Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria.   Getting access to blood samples from survivors of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been challenging, but Emory has a distinct advantage in having treated a small number of patients on US soil. All four of its former patients agreed to take part in the program, said Rafi Ahmed, director of the Emory Vaccine Center, who is leading the effort::b1843f6f51e114afa48cbef0d67a2b0d::ACKNOWLEDGED b1843f6f51e114afa48cbef0d67a2b0d

See More + The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa has taken a horrible human toll. Although the outbreak originated in rural Guinea, it has hit hardest in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in part because it has reached urban areas in these two countries, a factor that distinguishes this outbreak from previous episodes elsewhere. As of September 10, 2014, there had been 2,281 recorded deaths out of 4,614 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola. Epidemiological estimates are acknowledged as highly uncertain and are not the subject of this note. What is certain is that, particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone, government capacity is already overrun and the epidemic is impacting macroeconomic activity and budgetary resources. This report informs the response to the epidemic by estimating these macroeconomic and fiscal effects. Any such exercise is necessarily highly imprecise due to limited data and many uncertain factors, but it is still necessary in order to plan the economic assistance that must accompany the immediate humanitarian response. The goal is to help affected countries to recover and return to the robust economic growth they had experienced until the offset of this crisis. This report presents the World Bank's preliminary estimates of the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa for 2014 and 2015. Section 2 presents a single set of 2014 estimates for Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, based on available data on current economic activity as well as assumptions about the near-future impact. It also highlights current data on the limited current impacts on other countries in the region. Section 3 presents estimates for the impact by the end of 2015 for Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Because the epidemic and the behavioral responses to it have more time to diverge over the course of 2015, Section 3 presents two scenarios for 2015, which vary in the optimism of their assumptions regarding the epidemic and the success of donor and government policy and efforts to control it. The take-away messages from this analysis are a low Ebola scenario that corresponds to rapid containment within the three most severely affected countries, and a high Ebola scenario corresponds to slower containment in the three countries, with some broader regional contagion. A swift policy reaction by the international community is crucial. With potential the economic costs of the Ebola epidemic being so high, very substantial containment and mitigation expenditures would be cost-effective, if they successfully avert the worst epidemiological outcomes. To mitigate the medium term economic impact of the outbreak, current efforts by many partners to strengthen the health systems and fill the fiscal gaps in the core three countries are key priorities. Finally, this report does not take into account the longer term impacts generated by mortality, failure to treat other health conditions due to aversion behavior and lack of supply capacity, school closings and dropouts, and other shocks to livelihoods. It is truly focused on the short and medium-term inputs, over the next 18 months.  See Less -  ::cfe1183edca2ba148c41bda04a4df154::ACKNOWLEDGED fdd84f227b3488c2d0fb59e6faf7467a

According to an economic impact assessment for the World Bank Group, released ahead of a press briefing on Thursday, the regional financial impact could be as high as $32.6-billion by the end of 2015 should the deadly virus spread to neighbouring countries, some of which have large economies.  Already, the economic impacts of Ebola are very serious in the core three countries â particularly Liberia and Sierra Leone â where government capacity is already overrun and the outbreak is impacting economic activity and budgetary resources, said the World Bank Groupâs analysis, noting it could become catastrophic if containment is slow.  âBeyond the terrible toll in human lives and suffering, the Ebola epidemic currently afflicting West Africa is already having a measurable economic impact in terms of forgone output; higher fiscal deficits; rising prices; lower real household incomes and greater poverty,â the report said.  ::ccd7c29a367ce17741b12e33a42be2ba::ACKNOWLEDGED ccd7c29a367ce17741b12e33a42be2ba

In addition to lost lives, the disease is dealing a severe economic blow to families and governments. Closed borders and abandoned farms are driving up food costs leaving many people in rural communities hungry. Emergency spending on health services is drawing money from already cash-strapped government budgets. The epidemic could reverse years of economic gains made by countries in this developing part of the world.  Open Quotes Early estimates for growth in Guinea have been halved from 4.5% to 2.4% as a result of the disease.  Close Quotes  A new World Bank report outlines the short and medium-term toll the Ebola crisis could take on the three most heavily affected countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – if those countries and their partners don’t immediately ramp up efforts to contain the disease outbreak. Estimates of the impact on the three countries for 2015 range from $97 million (if the epidemic is rapidly contained) to $809 million (if control of the epidemic is delayed).    Guinea  The impact is already evident in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries with the highest number of Ebola cases. Early estimates for growth in Guinea have been halved from 4.5% to 2.4% as a result of the disease. Already among the poorest countries in West Africa with a population of 12 million, Guinea has seen the biggest losses in its agriculture industry. An exodus of farm workers from the countryside has meant lower exports of key products like cocoa and palm oil.  Sierra Leone  Sierra Leone, once navigating toward Middle Income status at an 11.3% annual growth rate could see growth of only 8% in 2014 and zero in 2015. The disease has spread to all but one of the country’s 13 districts, with four doctors and 30 nurses among the dead. The country has been devastated by restrictions on international travel, the closing of markets, disruption of farming activities and a slow-down in critical mining operations as a result of foreign workers fleeing the country for fear of contracting Ebola.  ::80f670544eee5e05c6c804ef17365816::ACKNOWLEDGED 80f670544eee5e05c6c804ef17365816

Although I thought I knew the Bank pretty well from my 20 years in its Development Economics Research Group (1986-2006), I gained a new appreciation of the skills of the country economists as I watched them gather and assemble tidbits of relevant data about how Ebola is affecting the economies of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.     For example, the country economist for Liberia was able to gather data on cement sales (see Figure 1), which tell the story of an exhilarating construction boom in 2013, very good news for a desperately poor economy recovering from years of civil war. Then around March of 2014 cement sales dove to mid-2013 levels.  Causality is murky, but it’s fair to ask whether this drop was a response to the discovery of the first West African Ebola case in neighboring Guinea.  The recovery of sales the following month to a level near the previous peak suggests that investors and construction contractors had shrugged off their worry, thinking that the outbreak had been contained.  But then in August, 2014, as evidence accumulated that Ebola was out of control in Monrovia, cement sales plummeted to pre-boom levels.  Since WHO’s latest update shows Liberia’s epidemic continuing to grow, it seems likely that the last quarter of 2014 will see further collapses in cement sales, to levels below those of 2010.   ::8b3f242b9a71df685763ad4d798483da::ACKNOWLEDGED 8b3f242b9a71df685763ad4d798483da

See More + The most severe impact of the Ebola epidemic, which began in Guinea in December 2013 and quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been in lost human lives and suffering. This report, prepared for the World Economic Forum at Davos, focuses on the indirect, economic costs, in particular the effects on economic output in 2015. Most of the economic cost is driven by aversion behavior, which consists of both the actions taken by individuals to avoid exposure to the illness and actions taken by investors in anticipation of those individual choices. The report first estimates the impact of the epidemic on gross domestic product (GDP) in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Here the report builds on sector-specific analysis to update World Bank forecasts for the three countries, and incorporates recent results of World Bank-financed cellphone surveys in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The authors evaluate the economic effects of the epidemic on the continent, beyond the three hardest-hit countries, using assessments by World Bank country economists across the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the report updates estimates from the global economic model of the research arm of the World Bank, to quantify the 2015 impact of the potential spread of the epidemic to other countries. Updated general equilibrium analysis suggests that further spread of the epidemic to other African economies, if the epidemic is not contained and instances of infection continue to occur in other countries, can potentially exact an economic toll of the order of 6 billion dollars. The results underscore the importance of: (a) Ebola and broader pandemic preparedness in African countries; and (b) reaching the goal of zero new cases as soon as possible in the three most affected countries.

The report, titled “The Economic Impact of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic: Short and Medium Term Estimates for West Africa,” was released yesterday.  Although there is still great uncertainty about the Ebola epidemic, our task was to produce best-effort estimates of its macroeconomic and fiscal impact using the best tools immediately available.  But Ebola is quite different from standard shocks to developing countries, including slow-moving diseases like diabetes or hypertension. The standard approach to estimating economic impact of diseases is to compute the cost of medical care (the “direct” cost) and the loss of output from people who can’t work (the “indirect cost”).1 But given the rapid spread and high fatality rate of Ebola, this approach would not come close to capturing the third quarter 2014 impact already visible to the World Bank’s country teams.  Drawing on previous work on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), we posit that a rapidly- moving, often fatal disease elicits “aversion behavior,” as economic agents withdraw from commercial interaction, shun what they perceive to be exposed assets, and postpone or divert investment from affected economies. Since “aversion behavior” appears nowhere in our economic models, we assume that aversion behavior leads to the withdrawal or reduced utilization of certain percentages of both labor and capital and to increased transaction costs on both domestic and international economic transactions.  ::d129ec1e6a9f40c46a4d3a2aa2fa412a::ACKNOWLEDGED d129ec1e6a9f40c46a4d3a2aa2fa412a

According to an economic impact assessment for the World Bank Group, released ahead of a press briefing on Thursday, the regional financial impact could be as high as $32.6-billion by the end of 2015 should the deadly virus spread to neighbouring countries, some of which have large economies.  Already, the economic impacts of Ebola are very serious in the core three countries â particularly Liberia and Sierra Leone â where government capacity is already overrun and the outbreak is impacting economic activity and budgetary resources, said the World Bank Groupâs analysis, noting it could become catastrophic if containment is slow.  âBeyond the terrible toll in human lives and suffering, the Ebola epidemic currently afflicting West Africa is already having a measurable economic impact in terms of forgone output; higher fiscal deficits; rising prices; lower real household incomes and greater poverty,â the report said.  ::3879b296cdef64c0af9348bd0159fe59::ACKNOWLEDGED 3879b296cdef64c0af9348bd0159fe59

This forgone output corresponds to $359 million in 2014 prices.  However, if Ebola is not contained, these estimates rise to $809 million in the three countries alone.

The Bank Group estimates that these three countries will lose at least US$1.6 billion in forgone economic growth in 2015 as a result of the epidemic.    But the new report — released on the eve of the 2015 World Economic Forum in Davos — also contains more positive news: the probability of spread and the associated economic costs beyond the three most-affected countries are now much lower than previously feared because of the intensive global and national responses to the epidemic over the past several months.  An earlier World Bank Group economic analysis (from October 8, 2014) found that the West Africa region alone could experience a downside scenario of US$25 billion in economic losses in 2015, but the current report estimates the range for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole to be from a low of US$500 million to a high of US$6.2 billion.  The national and international responses have resulted in a number of public health improvements within the three West African nations, including safer burial practices, earlier case detections, more health workers and treatment facilities, public awareness campaigns and stepped-up contact tracing. These policy and behavior responses have contributed to a lower risk of spread across borders. The lower estimates also reflect fast and effective containment measures taken in the neighboring countries of Mali, Nigeria and Senegal, all of which have now been declared Ebola-free.  “Even if Ebola is controlled and further outbreaks avoided,” said the report, “economic costs will be incurred across sub-Saharan Africa in 2015. Consumer and investor confidence has been eroded by the outbreak of the virus, and disruptions to travel and cross-border trade suggest cumulative losses of more than US$500 million across the region in 2015, outside the three directly affected countries.” The report said the losses could be closer to the higher end of the estimate — US$6 billion — if the Ebola outbreak were to spread through the region, reinforcing the need for a swift end to the epidemic.  “I am very encouraged to see Ebola transmission rates slowing markedly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and that other potential outbreaks have been averted because of swift action by other West African governments,” said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group, who will discuss the emerging lessons from the Ebola crisis with world leaders in Davos this week. “Yet as welcome as these latest signs are, we cannot afford to be complacent. Until we have zero new Ebola cases, the risk of continued severe economic impact to the three countries and beyond remains unacceptably high.”  The report notes that containment and preparedness efforts dramatically limited the potential impact of Ebola on the African economy, compared to earlier worst-case scenarios. The scope of the report did not include examining the national and international response to determine most effective policies in curtailing the spread of the virus.  One major lesson from the Ebola outbreak, said Kim, was for the world to respond much more quickly to epidemics.  “This report demonstrates why all countries should make investing in pandemic preparedness a top priority for 2015,” said Kim. “It points to the need for a global pandemic emergency financing facility that will enable the world to respond much more quickly and effectively to any future deadly outbreaks, and avoid the tragic and unnecessary human and economic costs that have resulted from the Ebola epidemic::af3c3505a8dd178a386d4d3e46576077::ACKNOWLEDGED af3c3505a8dd178a386d4d3e46576077

Although the outbreak originated in rural Guinea, it has hit hardest in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in part because it has reached urban areas in these two countries, a factor that distinguishes this outbreak from previous episodes elsewhere. As of September 10, 2014, there had been 2,281 recorded deaths out of 4,614 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola. Experts fear that the true numbers may be two to four times larger, due to underreporting. Misery and suffering have been intense, especially in Liberia where doctors have had to turning patients away for lack of space in Ebola treatment centers. Inevitably, before the outbreak is contained the human impacts will increase considerably over these numbers. Epidemiological estimates are acknowledged as highly uncertain and are not the subject of this note. What is certain is that limiting the human cost will require significant financial resources and a concerted partnership between international partners and the affected countries. Particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone, government capacity is already overrun and the epidemic is impacting macroeconomic activity and budgetary resources. This note informs the response to the epidemic by estimating these macroeconomic and fiscal effects. Any such exercise is necessarily highly imprecise due to limited data and many uncertain factors, but it is still necessary in order to plan the economic assistance that must accompany the immediate humanitarian response. The goal is to help affected countries to recover and return to the robust economic growth they had experienced until the offset of this crisis. en_US dc.language	 English::5dd00bd71af98d3b75e820a70244c1c8::ACKNOWLEDGED 5dd00bd71af98d3b75e820a70244c1c8

World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said, âThe primary cost of this tragic outbreak is in human lives and suffering, which has already been terribly difficult to bear. But our findings make clear that the sooner we get an adequate containment response and decrease the level of fear and uncertainty, the faster we can blunt Ebolaâs economic impact.â  âWe have seen in recent days a serious scaling up on the part of international donors to contain the Ebola epidemic. Todayâs report underscores the huge potential costs of the epidemic if we donât ramp up our efforts to stop it now,â said Kim.  The analysis uses two alternative scenarios to estimate the medium-term impact of the epidemic to the end of calendar year 2015. A âLow Ebolaâ scenario envisions rapid containment within the three core countries, while âHigh Ebolaâ corresponds to the upper ranges of current epidemiological estimates.  Estimates of impacts on output individually and in aggregate,  Entries are in current US dollars (with percentage points of GDP in brackets where appropriate).  The analysis estimates the short-term impact on output to be 2.1 percentage points of GDP in Guinea (reducing growth from 4.5 percent to 2.4 percent); 3.4 percentage points in Liberia (reducing growth from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent); and 3.3 percentage points in Sierra Leone (reducing growth from 11.3 percent to 8 percent). This forgone output corresponds to $359 million in 2014 prices.Â  However, if Ebola is not contained, these estimates rise to $809 million in the three countries alone. In Liberia, the hardest hit country, the High Ebola scenario sees output hit 11.7 percentage points in 2015 (reducing growth from 6.8 percent to -4.9 percent).  The short-term fiscal impacts are also large, at $93 million for Liberia (4.7 percent of GDP); $79 million for Sierra Leone (1.8 percent of GDP); and $120 million for Guinea (1.8 percent of GDP). Slow containment gaps would almost certainly lead to even greater financing gaps in 2015, the analysis finds.  Inflation and food prices were initially contained but are now rising in response to shortages, panic buying, and speculation.Â  Those families already vulnerable to food price shocks are becoming increasingly exposed. Exchange rate volatility has increased in all three countries, particularly since June, fueled by uncertainty and some capital flight.  The analysis finds that the largest economic effects of the crisis are not as a result of the direct costs (mortality, morbidity, caregiving, and the associated losses to working days) but rather those resulting from aversion behavior driven by fear of contagion.Â  This in turn leads to a fear of association with others and reduces labor force participation, closes places of employment, disrupts transportation, and motivates some government and private decision-makers to close sea ports and airports.Â  In the recent history of infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004 and the H1N1 flu epidemic of 2009, the analysis notes that behavioral effects have been responsible for as much as 80 â 90 percent of the total economic impact of the epidemics.  The findings of the analysis underline the need for a concerted international response.Â  External financing is clearly needed in the three core countries, and the impact estimates suggest that containment and mitigation expenditures as high as several billion dollars would be cost-effective if they successfully avert the worse scenario.Â   The analysis describes four related activities such a response should include:  The World Bank Group is mobilizing a $230 million financing package for the three countries hardest hit by the Ebola crisis, which will help contain the spread of infections, help communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis, and improve public health systems throughout West Africa. The WBG is supporting country responses in line with the WHO Roadmap, and is coordinating assistance closely with the UN and other international and country partners. As of mid-September 2014, of the pledged $230 million, the WBG has mobilized $117 million for the emergency response, which includes IDA* grants of $58 million for Liberia, $34 million for Sierra Leone, and $25 million for Guinea. These funds are paying for essential supplies and drugs, personal protective equipment and infection prevention control materials, health workers training, hazard pay and death benefits to Ebola health workers and volunteers, contact tracing, vehicles, data management equipment and door-to-door public health education outreach. Additional support will help strengthen countriesâ health systems and capacity to delivery essential health services, along with disease surveillance and laboratory networks to guard against future outbreaks.

Next come what experts call efforts to avoid infection – reductions of air travel and consumption of numerous mass services like transport, tourism, or retail shopping. / The financial damage caused by the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa that has already killed around three thousand people, is on track to set record losses.  “The most comprehensive estimate that I’ve seen was from the World Bank and they’ve estimated that it’s been between $2.2 and $7.4 bln just for 2014, and that could increase to an additional $1.6 or even 25.2 bln through 2015,” Chris Pardee, Manager of Health Intelligence at iJET International said.  The bulk of uncertainty applies to people’s unpredictable emotions, as fear, or what economists call aversion behavior, deals the strongest blow to the tiny nation’s economy, spreading economic pain beyond the direct cost of treating the virus.  But let’s take pure facts. As of early November, nearly half of those working in Liberia were no longer working, says the most recent round of mobile phone surveys conducted by the World Bank Group, the Liberian Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services and the Gallup Organization. Those engaged in self-employment activities have been the hardest hit. Only about 36 percent of previously self-employed workers outside of agriculture and about half of those originally engaged in wage labor were still working since the crisis unfolded. In October only, Liberia saw a 40 percent spike in imported rice prices. Nevertheless, over 70 percent of respondents said that regardless of price, they did not have enough money to afford food.  “The report actually focuses on Liberia, but I think this is true for all three of the affected countries. What we’ve seen is kind of a general slowdown – people aren’t working, there’re travel restrictions, goods and services can’t be provided, things can’t move,” Kristen Himelein, Senior Economist at the World Bank Group and the report’s author said.  The most recent data from World Bank Group says that the two-year regional financial impact is about to reach $32.6 bln by the end of next year, in case the killer virus continues to surge in the three worst-affected states and spreads to neighboring regions. But it only remains to be seen whether one of the deadliest viruses known to man is going to be one of the most high priced as well.

Simandou, in the forests of eastern Guinea, is Africa's largest iron ore mine and infrastructure project. Vale, the world's biggest iron ore producer, was involved in Simandou until April. It evacuated six international members of staff and put the rest of the workforce in the area on leave.  Rio Tinto, the world's third largest mining company, which owns a share in Simandou, has donated $100,000 to the World Health Organization's work in the area and is also making sanitation equipment available to local people there.  SmelterSteelmakers and miners have been hit by the outbreak A smaller British company, London Mining, has moved out some its non-essential expatriate staff from Sierra Leone, where mining has accounted for much of the country's recent growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, Sierra Leone's output grew by 20% last year; excluding iron ore mining, it grew by 5.5%.  But like Rio Tinto, London Mining has also donated money towards tackling the spread of Ebola, and educating local communities about the virus.

While the Ebola outbreaks in both Nigeria and Senegal officially ended in October 2014 and both countries declared free of Ebola, the disease is raging in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.  The ECA report raises the alarm on the risk of a rise in mortality of diseases not related to Ebola and also points out the wider impacts of the virus on the livelihoods of those affected.  Educational systems, rising social stigma, unemployment, and decreased food security are some of the big issues that Ebola-affected countries must deal with, according to the report.  Despite the alarm, Carlos called for a careful and cautious approach to the response.  - CAJ News  ::cc85a779108155f72a4ffb1eafadfd3c::ACKNOWLEDGED cc85a779108155f72a4ffb1eafadfd3c

The report describes a four per cent fall over 2014 in the 11.3 per cent growth rate projected for Sierra Leone before the crisis. Guinea and Liberia are also expected to see large reductions, with the total fiscal impact for the three countries in 2014 topping $500 million, about five per cent of their combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  With investors steering clear, growth estimates for 2015 have also been revised down, the report notes. Guinea and Sierra Leone are expected to see their economies contract – by 0.2 per cent and two percent respectively – while predicted growth for Liberia has been reduced to three percent. Pre-Ebola growth estimates for 2015 in Guinea were 4.3 per cent; in Sierra Leone were 8.9 per cent; and in Liberia were 6.8 per cent.  Expected Forgone GDP in 2015 due to Ebola and Global Economic Conditions (in US dollars)  That implies total forgone income in 2015 of around $1.6 billion, with around $500 million lost by Guinea, $900 million by Sierra Leone and $200 million by Liberia – more than 12 per cent of their combined gross domestic products (GDPs).  Despite its warnings, the new report revises the Bank's previous estimate of the probability of the epidemic's spread and the associated economic costs beyond the three most-affected countries.  Thanks in large part to the intensive global and national responses over the past several months, the projected downside scenario of $25 billion in economic losses for 2015 no longer applies. For sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, the range of downside risk extends from a low of $500 million to a high of $6.2 billion.  Region-wide losses could be closer to the report's higher end estimate of $6 billion if Ebola does spread beyond the three worst affected countries, while the minimum expected loss of $500 million is attributed to eroded consumer and investor confidence since the outbreak, as well as disruption to travel and cross-border trade.  Containment and preparedness efforts have dramatically limited the potential impact, as have public health improvements, such as safer burials, better detection, public awareness campaigns, more health workers and facilities, and better contact tracing. At the same time, neighbouring countries have contributed to reduced risk of spread across borders having adopted fast and effective containment measures.  “This report demonstrates why all countries should make investing in pandemic preparedness a top priority for 2015,” said Mr. Kim, noting that a major lesson from the outbreak is the need for much quicker global responses to disease outbreaks.  “It points to the need for a global pandemic emergency financing facility that will enable the world to respond much more quickly and effectively to any future deadly outbreaks, and avoid the tragic and unnecessary human and economic costs that have resulted from the Ebola epidemic.”  The Bank Group is mobilizing nearly US$1 billion in financing for the countries hardest hit by the Ebola crisis. This includes US$518 million from IDA for the epidemic response, and at least $450 million from IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, to enable trade, investment, and employment in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.  ::3b6451b977acdccdceaea8b6f3d6b219::ACKNOWLEDGED 3b6451b977acdccdceaea8b6f3d6b219

[Reuters] There is not yet any macroeconomic analysis of Ebola's impact on West Africa, withÂ IMF figures only indicatingÂ a modest decrease inÂ growth for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But NGOs on the ground describeÂ the situation as âcatastrophicâ.  Amara Konneh, Liberiaâs minister of finance, recently said that his country's projected gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2014 would need to be revised downwards from the 5.9% forecast, as a result of the crisis.  Reacting to a US$52 million (â¬40 million) grant provided by the World Bank, Konneh said the government needs about US$200 million (â¬156 million) to fight the Ebola epidemic, and bring Liberia out of recession.  According to the IMF, the projected growth rate could decline for Sierra Leone from 11.3% to 8%, for Liberia from 5.9% to 2.5% and for Guinea from 3.5% to 2.4%. The IMF admits that the situation is evolving, and that the crisis is not over yet. All the three countries are covered by IMF programs.  The reality on the ground appears to indicate that the IMF needs to revise its figures.  Meinie Nicolai, President of MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) Belgium, told EurActiv that the epidemic was havingÂ a major impact in the affected countries in Western Africa and called the situation catastrophic. She insisted that the international response to the emergency was âbelowÂ standardâ and âway too slowâ.  Nicolai, who just returned to Brussels from Liberia and Sierra Leone, said that it was important to remember that the epidemic Â wasÂ still spreading, that it is highly deadly, and that she could not predictÂ when it would be contained.  ::d1648e55339423f8582c7cec2f9e6605::ACKNOWLEDGED d1648e55339423f8582c7cec2f9e6605

Governments reckon the worst of those effects are yet to be felt, but they are still busy trying to calculate what the outbreak is going to cost them. Here are Liberia’s thoughts:  The tiny post-conflict country has been growing at upwards of 8% over the last couple of years, but won’t expect anything like that kind of luck now. The government is still number-crunching with the International Monetary Fund, but it reckons Ebola will shave more than 2% of growth rates this year, putting estimates at 3.5%.  Finance minister Amara Konneh says that’s mostly because of damage done to mining, agriculture and service industries, as investors evacuate foreign workers, borders close, and international flights are suspended. Bread-basket regions are under quarantine, making agricultural trade impossible. Sime Darby, the world’s largest listed producer of oil palm, is slowing production and Sifca Group, an Ivory Coast-based agribusiness, has halted rubber exports. Mr Konneh expects iron ore exports to fall in 2015 because investors like China Union and ArcelorMittal are scaling down their operations and putting expansion plans on hold. Foreign exchange shortages are a big concern.  The finance ministry is bracing itself for up to $30m in lost revenues; a “significant” amount, it says, in the context of its meagre budget. Add to that the high cost of fighting the virus, and the country will run up a big fiscal deficit, even in light of international assistance. The government is putting in place fiscal austerity measures to compensate for that, including suspending all official foreign travel. But it may still may have to turn to the IMF for additional help.  Right now, Mr Konneh says, the priority is that the government allocates enough money to the healthcare sector. After that, it worries about paying its public servants. Security to enforce quarantines and curfews comes next. The rest, for now, may have to wait.::433360bacec675c024fbaef7330b3ece::ACKNOWLEDGED 433360bacec675c024fbaef7330b3ece

The economy has fallen into ârecession because of the deadly Ebola virus disease,â Konneh told reporters in the capital, Monrovia. âIt means we have to tighten our belts by reducing expenditure to within our means.â  The International Monetary Fund cut its expansion forecast for Liberiaâs economy to 2.5 percent this year from a previous estimate of 5.9 percent, spokesman Ismaila Dieng said yesterday. The other West African nations at the center of the outbreak also had their outlooks reduced. Sierra Leone was cut to 8 percent from 11.3 percent and Guinea to 2.4 percent from 3.5 percent, said Dieng.  Those countries each need as much as $130 million in fiscal and balance of payment support and the IMF is exploring ways it can help, IMF spokesman William Murray said. Expansion in Liberia, whose economy was gutted during a 1989-2003 civil war, was 8.7 percent last year, said Konneh.  Liberia has been the worst hit by the Ebola outbreak, recording 1,224 of the 2,288 deaths since the first case in December, according to the World Health Organization. Liberiaâs Ministry of Health puts the countryâs death toll at 1,263. Thereâs also been eight deaths in Nigeria, the WHO says.     ::1f78191fdb29e2ebcb2160bfb83e9981::ACKNOWLEDGED 1f78191fdb29e2ebcb2160bfb83e9981

This has created a labor shortage and will likely result in low levels of production on cash crops such as palm oil, cocoa and rubber. âSuch a decline in both food and cash crop production would severely impact household incomes, thus reducing purchasing power and inhibiting food access,âa âspecial alertâ from the U.N agency says.  So far, more than 1,500 people have died from Ebola, and public health officials have started to restrict movement of people and establish quarantine zones. While these measures may help stop the fatal virus from spreading, economists fear what it will mean for the regionâs economy, which is highly dependent on agriculture.   âAlthough necessary, these restrictions have resulted in food security concerns that curtailed the movement of goods and services, including food items, leading to panic buying, food shortages, and significant price hikes,â the report says.   Earlier this year, analysts predicted good harvests thanks to rainfall levels in most parts of these countries. But as harvest season approaches, workers in these areas are far from their typical routines, which will aggravate already high food prices.   U.N. data shows that nearly 80 percent of household income is spent on food in some cases, which means the price increase could seriously affect peopleâs access to the necessities. In Liberia, for example, the price of the staple food cassava increased up to 150 percent in just the first two weeks of August, according to U.N. data.   ::9394490ceaf27cb7c2f2d3f7e95258cc::ACKNOWLEDGED 9394490ceaf27cb7c2f2d3f7e95258cc

Nearly 2,500 people had died there from the disease by mid October, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  There have been only three diagnosed cases of Ebola in the U.S. â none in New York. But while the outbreak has largely been limited to West Africa, local communities are feeling the effects of this disease in other ways.  For example, Brown recently started sending back about $300 a monthÂ â double what he used to â and heâs fundraising for the Staten Island Liberians Ebola Fund.  Brown says basic items have become much more expensive in Liberia and members of his family there are staying home from work. Which means they aren't earning, and they need his support.  âMy cousins who cannot go out in the street to sell water definitely are calling me on a daily basis, [saying,] âOh uncle Telee, how am I going to make it? I donât have food,ââ he says.  But coming up with extra money each month for family members in Liberia, is making things tight for Brown and his family in New York.  âIt makes me reduce the amount of milk that I used to drink,â he says. âIf I maybe ate three times a day, I have to save on a meal and eat two times a day.â  Those kinds of cutbacks can have ripple effects in the local economy.  Brown has reduced his visits to an outdoor market that sells traditional West African food like hot sauces and cooked meats.  âNobody got money to buy food here to eat,â says vendor Sonnie Selma, explaining that many regular customers are sending all their money back to family members. She says now sheâs worried about paying rent.  But itâs not just the lack of money thatâs keeping people away.  Solomon Reeves, a child care specialist whoâs been fundraising to send money and medical supplies back to Liberia, says thereâs also a lot of fear about who might have traveled to West Africa recently.  âBecause of the Ebola, people donât really come [to the market] the way they used to come here,â he says. âTheyâre afraid.â  Before he came to the market, Reeves said his wife told him to be careful; he noticed recently that a friend didnât want to shake his hand; and there have been a couple of reports of Liberians being told to stay home from work.  The entire Liberian community here is suffering economically and socially because of this disease, even though the closest diagnosed case is well over a thousand miles away.  ::8f01da6a1a8493f56c50349dbd18c209::ACKNOWLEDGED 8f01da6a1a8493f56c50349dbd18c209

Francisco Ferreira told a lecture in Johannesburg that successful containment of Ebola in some West African countries made its gloomiest forecasts less likely, although economic damage could still escalate if there was any complacency.  "The risk of the highest case of economic impact of Ebola has been reduced because of the success of containment in some countries. It has not gone to zero because a great level of preparedness and focus is still needed," Ferreira said.  "I would say the outlook has moved closer to the lower case of $3-$4bn, than the upper case ($32bn)," he added.  Ferreira said, however, that the Ebola crisis had already ravaged tourism in Africa because the "fear factor" kept visitors away from countries even where there had been no cases of the virus, like Kenya and South Africa.  In a report in October on the possible economic impact of the Ebola epidemic, the World Bank had said that if the virus spread significantly outside the epicentre states of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, this could potentially cost Africa tens of billions of dollars in disrupted cross-border trade, supply chains and tourism.  The bank said a scaled-up global response was needed to prevent this worst case scenario. Since then, the United Nations has led international efforts to send more medical personnel to the Ebola zone and increase funding to fight the worst recorded outbreak of the deadly haemorrhagic virus.  The latest WHO Ebola tally on November 14 reported 5 177 deaths out of 14 133 cases, mostly in the three worst-hit countries.  Ferreira also highlighted a more than 30% drop in global oil prices since June as a major concern for the fiscal stability in African oil producers, particularly the continent's largest crude exporter, Nigeria.   ::7d799917b36106362e450c2e84b82f27::ACKNOWLEDGED 7d799917b36106362e450c2e84b82f27

It noted that, along with the toll in human lives and suffering, the epidemic was creating higher fiscal deficits in the affected countries -- as well as higher prices, lower incomes and an overall increase in poverty levels.  In the short-term, the economic impact for the worst-hit countries has been enormous: With Ebola-related losses costing Liberia an estimated 4.7 percent of its GDP, it is also draining off nearly two percent of gross domestic product from both Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Adding to the tragedy, according to a new report by The Brookings Institution, is that Sierra Leone and Liberia had seen their economies strengthen prior to the outbreak, as the two nations recovered from years of civil war and political upheaval.  The epidemic is also crippling West African economies via a wide spectrum of factors. International travel quarantines, for example, are reducing revenues from trade, transport and tourism. At the same time, the epidemic has halted a large percentage of the region's agricultural activity, which is expected to affect crop yields on several essential food staples, while creating food price spikes.  And fear of disease has eroded investor confidence, which in turn has restricted work, production and output at several international mining and oil operations in the region.  But the economic impact doesn't stop in West Africa. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is projecting that around 1.4 million people will become infected with Ebola before the epidemic runs its course. And the United Nations is estimating the costs of containing the Ebola outbreak at about $1 billion.  "This is not just a health crisis," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last month. "It has grave humanitarian, economic and social consequences that could spread far beyond the affected countries."  However, as World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim noted in September, "our findings make clear that the sooner we get an adequate containment response and decrease the level of fear and uncertainty, the faster we can blunt Ebola's economic impact."  © 2014 CBS Interactive Inc..

The economy has fallen into ârecession because of the deadly Ebola virus disease,â Konneh told reporters in the capital, Monrovia, yesterday. âIt means we have to tighten our belts by reducing expenditure to within our means.â  The International Monetary Fund cut its expansion forecast for Liberiaâs economy to 2.5 percent this year from a previous estimate of 5.9 percent, spokesman Ismaila Dieng said yesterday. The other West African nations at the center of the outbreak also had their outlooks reduced. Sierra Leone was cut to 8 percent from 11.3 percent and Guinea to 2.4 percent from 3.5 percent, said Dieng.  Those countries each need as much as $130 million in fiscal and balance of payment support and the IMF is exploring ways it can help, IMF spokesman William Murray said. Expansion in Liberia, whose economy was gutted during a 1989-2003 civil war, was 8.7 percent last year, said Konneh.  Liberia has been the worst hit by the Ebola outbreak, recording 1,224 of the 2,288 deaths since the first case in December, according to the World Health Organization. Liberiaâs Ministry of Health puts the countryâs death toll at 1,263. Thereâs also been eight deaths in Nigeria, the WHO says.  ::93b959efa08495db48d1dcdc39ecf6ff::ACKNOWLEDGED 93b959efa08495db48d1dcdc39ecf6ff

The crisis is resulting in flat or negative income growth and creating large fiscal needs in all three countries, as they work to eradicate the virus. This update presents the World Bank s most recent analysis of the economic effects of the Ebola epidemic on the three countries. All three had been growing rapidly in recent years, and into the first half of 2014. But GDP growth estimates for 2014 have been revised sharply downward since pre-crisis estimates. Projected 2014 growth in Liberia is now 2.2 percent (versus 5.9 percent before the crisis and 2.5 percent in October). Projected 2014 growth in Sierra Leone is now 4.0 percent (versus 11.3 percent before the crisis and 8.0 percent in October). Projected 2014 growth in Guinea is now 0.5 percent (versus 4.5 percent before the crisis and 2.4 percent in October). The World Bank s October report on the economic impact of Ebola (report no. 91219 released at the 2014 Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank) found that if the epidemic continues in the three worst-affected countries and spreads to neighboring countries, the two-year regional financial impact could range from a "low Ebola" estimate of $3.8 billion to a "high Ebola" estimate of $32.6 billion. These scale estimates of potential impact remain valid: the epidemic is not yet under control. Containment, combined with a full-fledged financial recovery effort to restart business activity and bring back investors, are now both therefore urgently needed for the region to improve on the downbeat forecasts in this update.

The report comes as World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim begins a two-day visit to West Africa to assess the epidemic’s impact and discuss with governments and international agencies what steps need to be taken to reach the goal of zero cases as soon as possible.  This report updates the World Bank Group’s October 8 analysis of the economic effects of the Ebola crisis on the three hardest-hit countries. GDP growth estimates for 2014 have been revised sharply downward since pre-crisis estimates to 2.2 percent for Liberia (versus 5.9 percent pre-crisis and 2.5 percent in October); and 4.0 percent for Sierra Leone (versus 11.3 percent pre-crisis and 8.0 percent in October); and 0.5 percent for Guinea (versus 4.5 percent pre-crisis and 2.4 percent in October). All three countries had been growing rapidly in recent years and into the first half of 2014.  In addition, the World Bank Group is now projecting negative growth for 2015 of -0.2% in Guinea (down from pre-crisis estimates of 4.3 percent and 2.0 percent in October) and -2.0% in Sierra Leone (down from 8.9 percent and 7.7 percent in October). In Liberia, where there are signs of progress in containing the epidemic and some increasing economic activity, the updated 2015 growth estimate is 3.0 percent, an  increase from 1.0 percent in October but still less than half the pre-crisis estimate of 6.8 percent. These latest projections imply forgone income across the three countries in 2014–15 totaling more than $2 billion.  “This report reinforces why zero Ebola cases must be our goal. While there are signs of progress, as long as the epidemic continues, the human and economic impact will only grow more devastating,” said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group. “As we accelerate the immediate health response, the international community must also do everything we can to help the affected countries back on the road to economic recovery and development.”    The report finds that the total fiscal impact is more than half a billion dollars in 2014 alone, imposing additional budget needs of more than 6.0 percent of GDP in Liberia, more than 3.0 percent in Guinea, and more than 2.5 percent in Sierra Leone. Governments have also been forced to cut public investments – such as Liberia’s Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, which now remains on hold in the absence of foreign contractors – by more than $160 million across the three countries, hurting future growth prospects.

Konneh has concluded discussions with officials of the World Bank, IMF and other development partners aimed at mobilizing support for the government's fight against the Ebola epidemic. In conversation with the World Bank, Konneh requested that the World Bank and other development partners use their convening power to assist Liberia raise additional resources to fight Ebola and also support the country's economic recovery plan. For more than a week, Minister Konneh and delegation, including Central Bank Governor Dr. Mills Jones, the President of the Liberia Bank for Investment and Development, John Davies, Representative Munah Pelham-Youngblood amongst others have been in Washington DC working to make Liberia's case. The delegation articulated clearly Liberia was looking for new avenues of support to fight Ebola and deal with probable associated economic and social issues. The Liberian Team requested that bilateral and multilateral partners to not re-program existing commitments but rather provide injection of new funds. Minister Konneh said the discussions were fruitful and Liberia was able to make a strong case for the World Bank to provide additional assistance following the provision of US$52 million of crisis funds last month. âWe aiming to raise around $50 million dollars as direct support and we hope our key projects will be accelerated, including work on the Redlight to Gbarnga road, and feasibility studies on the Ganta to Tappita road," Konneh said. Minister Konneh also met with the head of USAID Raj Shah, who assured him that every support will be provided to help stop the transmission of Ebola. Discussions were also held with the Millennium Challenge Corporation over a possible funding window that could be harnessed to accelerate Liberia's economic stabilization and recovery. Discussions were also held with the IMF over additional support beyond the recent $48 million dollars under the Extended Credit Facility program to be channeled through the Central Bank of Liberia. Efforts were also made for additional commitments under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF. The Head of the (IMF) Madam Christine Lagarde suggested to her colleagues that there is a need for more budgetary support for Liberia as short-term spending is critical during these difficult eras. In the US, Minister Amara Konneh consummated a deal worth US$27 million dollars with the European Investment Bank (EIB) for the rehabilitation of the Roberts International Airport Runway. EIB also expressed willingness to work together on future pipeline projects. In meeting with the Swedish International Development Office, Minister Konneh pleaded with the Sweds to increase their support to Liberia, in addition to the US $10 million dollar committed through International Non-Governmental Organizations. In a related development, the International Finance Corporation has agreed to provide an immediate injection of roughly $15 million dollars to the banking sector for trade financing. The IFC is also actively exploring ways to provide financing to small businesses, particularly in the Agriculture sector.

Mitigating the economic impacts of Ebola will be crucial for post-disease reconstruction. Please join us for a panel discussion on this topic featuring David Evans, Senior Economist at the World Bank Africa Region and Abebe Aemro Selassie, Deputy Director of the International Monetary Fund African Department.

According to Francisco Ferreira, the World Bank's Chief Economist for the Africa Region,"The cost of the Ebola epidemic for Sub-Saharan Africa's economy is likely to be closer to $3-4 billion and not the worst-case scenario of $32 billion," reports News Daily.  "The risk of the highest case of economic impact of Ebola has been reduced because of the success of containment in some countries," Ferreira said.  An international effort led by the United Nations has increased medical personnel to the most needed areas.  The World Bank Group has attained roughly $1 billion in financing for the countries hardest hit by the epidemic. The U.S., England, Germany, Australia and Japan have contributed the most, according to The Telegraph.  However, "Relief efforts must focus not only on those directly affected by the virus, but also on those in the poorest communities for whom market access, mobility, and food security continue to get worse," said Ana Revenga, Senior Director of the Poverty Global Practice at the World Bank.  In addition to the 5,177 deaths tallied by the World Health organization, African jobs and tourism have also been affected.  Based on phone surveys, nearly half of those working in Liberia when the outbreak began in March are no longer working, according to the World Bank.  "The Ebola crisis has already ravaged tourism in Africa because the fear factor kept visitors away from countries even where there had been no cases of the virus, like Kenya and South Africa," according to Ferreira.  "Successful containment of Ebola in some West African countries made the gloomiest forecasts less likely, but the economic damage could still escalate if there was any complacency," Ferreira added.

A prolonged outbreak, however, will threaten mineral production in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea if essential supplies are disrupted and employees stay away from work too long.  Or worse: should a miner or family member contract the deadly virus.  Force majeure  Steel and mining company ArcelorMittal on Friday announced force majeure on a project that is planned to triple its iron ore production in Liberia because of the Ebola epidemic sweeping West Africa.  ArcelorMittal, which mines and ships 5 million tonnes of iron ore a year in Liberia, has been working on an expansion project that would increase shipments to 15 million tonnes of iron ore.  First production from the new project is planned by the end of next year. However, contractors working on the project have declared force majeure and were moving people out of the country, ArcelorMittal said.  Declarations of force majeure are used to prevent companies from being sued when extraordinary circumstances beyond their control prevent the fulfilment of contractual obligations.  Taking stock  The company is assessing the impact on the project schedule and hoped to restart work as soon as possible. It added the force majeure only affects the new project and other operations in Yekepa and Buchanan are continuing as normal.  "While the recent developments are very concerning, at present we believe that the emergency procedures and other measures developed and currently in place at all ArcelorMittal sites in Liberia make it possible to continue our phase 1 operations," Bill Scotting, chief executive of ArcelorMittal Mining, said.  In common with other mining companies in the region, ArcelorMittal has enforced measures to try to prevent Ebola's spread.  ArcelorMittal, listed on stock exchanges including New York, Amsterdam, Paris and Luxembourg, is one of the world's five largest producers of iron ore and metallurgical coal.  In 2013, ArcelorMittal had revenue of $79.4bn and crude steel production of 91.2 million tonnes, while own iron ore production reached 58.4 million tonnes.  The potential to impact businesses  "I think everyone is mindful that it's something that has the potential to impact businesses," said Mark Bristow, chief executive of Randgold Resources Ltd, which mines gold in Mali, across the border from Guinea.  Though it has no mines in countries affected thus far, Randgold is among several miners in West Africa to have launched preventive measures against an outbreak that has killed more than 900 people in four countries.  The World Health Organisation has called the epidemic an "extraordinary event" that constitutes an international health risk. There is no known cure for Ebola, which is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids.  The outbreak began in eastern Guinea in February, before spreading to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cases have also been recorded in Nigeria.  Not a single case of Ebola has been recorded among the employees of those companies mining and exploring large reserves of oil, iron ore, bauxite and gold in the region. But some have sent workers home and scaled back or suspended exploration.  Other firm's respond  Australia-listed Tawana Resources NL, which is developing the Mofe Creek iron ore project 20 km (12 miles) from the Liberian coast, said on Friday it was halting non-essential field work. Its stock fell nearly 19 percent.  "What we have seen now, because of the movements of non-essential personnel, is that exploration activity is starting to be curtailed," said Paul Renken, analyst at VSA Capital, an investment bank focused on natural resources.  Canadian Overseas Petroleum Ltd, ExxonMobil Corp's partner in a venture to explore the Block LB-13 project off the coast of Liberia, has said that drilling will be delayed due to the "reduced presence of expatriates".  Some miners, including Sierra Rutile Ltd and African Minerals Ltd, are screening staff for early signs of the virus and running community education programmes.  AngloGold Ashanti is also controlling the movement of workers to and from its Siguiri gold mine in Guinea, only 25 km from the town of the same name, where cases have been reported, said company spokesperson Chris Nthite.  But it will be difficult, if not impossible, for mining companies throughout West Africa to restrict the movement of their employees indefinitely.  "If the situation goes on for another two or three months, then I think we should start to expect problems," said John Meyer, a mining analyst at brokerage SP Angel.  He said this would be particularly true in the event that Ebola were to afflict communities that serve the mines, "because the mines will want to cut themselves off, but the families will want to be with their breadwinners".

West Africa is battling the worst ever outbreak of Ebola, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) reporting the death toll has exceeded 1,200, with deaths recorded in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Guinea.  WA-based Resolute Mining has three gold mines in Africa and Australia. Its Syama mine in Mali is a few hundred kilometres from the border with Guinea.  Chief executive officer Peter Sullivan said while mine operations are not yet affected, the company is educating surrounding communities about the threat of the virus spreading.  "It's business as usual at the site, but obviously we are monitoring the situation," he said.  "We've carried out precautionary activities at our site to ensure we are best prepared should the virus enter Mali.  What's concerning about this outbreak is it has gone on longer and impacted on more people than previous outbreaks.

London Mining, which employs 1,400 people at its iron ore mine in Marampa, 120 miles east of the capital Freetown, and is building an Ebola treatment centre, appointed administrators on Thursday after failing to find a buyer for the severely debt-laden firm.  The collapse of the company raises fears about international efforts to combat Ebola, which has claimed about 4,500 lives in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.  London Mining is building a 130-bed Ebola treatment centre near Lunsar, 60 miles east of Freetown, and has donated Le 709m (Â£103,000) to Sierra Leoneâs efforts to fight the spread of the disease.  There are also fears about the increased risk to London Miningâs staff if the mine ceases operations. At present, all staff have their temperature checked twice a day, and medical staff are on hand to address any concerns. None of the companyâs employees have yet contracted the disease.  London Mining and its administrators said they would do all they could to keep the mine going while they search for a buyer, but said âalthough at this time this is not confirmedâ.  Dan Desjardins, London Miningâs managing director, who has been central to coordinating efforts to fight the spread of Ebola, said on 8 October: âWe are part of this community and this nation. A strengthened healthcare system is essential for safeguarding the health of our employees and our host communities .  âWe believe it is our duty to provide what help we can to stem the spread of this disease.â  The heavily-indebted company, which has been pushed to the brink by collapsing iron prices combined with the difficulty of working through the Ebola crisis, is one of Sierra Leoneâs biggest employers and contributes about 10% of the nationâs GDP.  The administrator, PwC, said the company has already held âadvanced discussionsâ with several potential buyers, and âit is hoped these discussions will mean that a sale of Marampa can now be concluded quickly, with operations continuing and the workforce protectedâ.  Russell Downs, joint administrator and partner at PwC said: âThe collapse in iron ore prices and the resulting impacts on this business have been very dramatic. Our focus is to ensure that a buyer is found for the Marampa mine operations given it is such an important part of the Sierra Leone economy. We are liaising with key stakeholders and asking for a short window of forbearance as we look to conclude a transaction.â  Graeme Hossie, London Miningâs chief executive, said: âI salute all our employees for their dedication and contribution in creating what is now an important part of Sierra Leoneâs economy and ongoing development.  âI also applaud them for the ongoing leadership role our team has played within the private sector in Sierra Leone in helping address the challenges of the current Ebola crisis. The Marampa mine retains excellent fundamentals and it is our sincere wish for it to find the appropriate financial support to continue operating over the longer term.â  London Mining, which has been operating in Sierra Leone since 2005, suspended trading in its shares on 10 October after warning that it did not have enough cash to continue to run the mine. The shares, which had traded above Â£4 in 2011, were suspended at 0.75p valuing the company at just Â£1m.  Potential buyers for the company include Indiaâs third-largest steelmaker, JSW Steel, and Frank Timis, the founder of African Minerals, which owns a neighbouring mine.  Standard Chartered, the companyâs biggest lender, had already hired PwC to negotiate with potential bidders.  London Mining has warned that the Ebola outbreak could cost it an additional $1 per tonne of iron ore produced.  Liberiaâs finance minister, Amara Konneh, warned on Thursday that the Ebola crisis would stall the countries economy for at least the next year. âGrowth is expected to be 0% for 2015,â he said in an interview with Monrovia-based Front Page Africa.  Konnehâs prediction is worse than the latest World Bank estimate of 2.5%, down from the previous projection of 5.9%.  Konneh said Ebola has âseriously affected economic activities and livelihoods throughout the country with domestic food production, mining activities, hospitality industry, and transport services all decliningâ.  The Ebola crisis has caused billionaire Lakshmi Mittalâs steel empire ArcelorMittal to delay expansion of its iron-ore mine in the country and Malaysian giant Sime Darby has reduced its Liberian palm oil operations.

The quarantine, however, has made it almost impossible to get enough food to the capital, Freetown. Thousands of workers such as Sesay sit at home. (Richard Evans, a spokesman for mining contractor Dawnus, confirmed that a âlarge numberâ of staff had been furloughed with pay and says Sesayâs complaint is the first heâs heard of anyone not receiving money.) From Freetownâs hilly streets overlooking the Gulf of Guinea, residents spend their days in their houses worrying about costs for food and fuel, which are rising despite government promises to crack down on price gougers.  Liberia has banned public gatherings and told nonessential civil servants to stay home. The government is even planning to close open-air markets, a measure that will probably push up prices in the capital, Monrovia. At the crowded Duala market in the city center, food seller Mary Kolubah says business has slowed. The wholesale shop where she buys bags of rice to resell in smaller, paper-wrapped quantities raised prices by 10 percent recently, she says. Nearby, meat seller Amadu Bah, 46, sits idle at his empty stall. Traders from Guinea and Sierra Leone cannot bring their cattle across the border region, the area hardest hit by the disease. âIâm out of business now,â he says, âbecause selling cow meat is the only thing Iâve known since I was 25 years old.â  This marks the first time the disease, identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, has killed anyone in West Africa. The virus struck just as the three countries were starting to bounce back from a past of violence and instability. Liberia is recovering from a civil war that spilled into neighbor Sierra Leone during the 1990s, leaving both economies ruined. In 2010, Guinea, the worldâs biggest bauxite exporter, held its first democratic elections since independence, following decades of erratic military rule. The health crisis has been compounded by a distrust of government rooted in the three countriesâ unstable past: Officials are still struggling to convince locals that Ebola exists and isnât a hoax.

Unfortunately, with mining stocks and the Ebola virus itâs hard to tell which is which. We analyze the impact of Ebola on the mining industry.  In March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a major Ebola outbreak in Guinea, the first of its kind in the region. While only transmitted via bodily fluids and not nearly as contagious as airborne-illnesses like SARS or the avian flu, over 1,100 people have died in West Africa because of the disease.  With fear mongering in the press about a âglobal pandemicâ, this is sparking unnecessary volatility in stocks with exposure to the region.  Make no mistake: There are real economic consequences to the disease and the way companies react to it. But it is up to investors to discern the genuine threats from the media-induced hysteria.  Assessing the impact of Ebola on mines  Affected countries Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone house vast natural resources miners seek to tap. Although there havenât been any Ebola cases reported at any mines yet, many companies are taking precautions. On Friday August 8, Tawana Resources, an Australian miner developing an iron ore project off the Liberian coast, said it was halting non-essential fieldwork. Its stock dropped almost 19 percent as a result.  Non-essential fieldwork is not the same as shutting down production. Did Tawana deserve that kind of slide? Or what about African Minerals, an iron ore miner based in Sierra Leone? In the space of two weeks its shares have been cut in half in part because of Ebola concerns, even though the company announced on August 6 that none of its workers had it and production

Five new suspected infections were reported in the last 24 hours, the UN's World Health Organisation (WHO), bringing the total to 127.  Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has warned of an unprecedented epidemic that is testing weak health systems across West Africa. Suspected cases of one of the world's most lethal infectious diseases have also been reported in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The epicentre of Guinea's two-month old outbreak has been in the southeast, close to its main iron ore reserves.The country is also the world's top exporter of bauxite, the raw material used in aluminium production, and has rich deposits gold.  "Everyone is practising precautionary strict hygiene but there has been no real impact on production so far," a senior executive at a mining company told Reuters, asking not to be named.  The executive said he had been placed on extended leave, while other companies were preventing people from entering or leaving their mines.  Miners concerned about Conakry Firms were more concerned by what was happening in the densely populated capital Conakry than in remote mining sites in the interior, where controls were easier to put in place, he added.  The WHO has reported 12 suspected cases and four deaths in the ocean-front city of 2-million people. WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl said all the cases in Conakry were linked to one man who came from the central Guinean town of Dobala, about 300 km away.  "Unfortunately, this one person infected both family members and health care workers when he went to Conakry for medical attention and died," Hartl told Reuters in Geneva.  Brazilian iron ore miner Vale said its VBG joint venture with BSG Resources (BSGR) – the mining arm of Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz's business conglomerate – had pulled its six international staff out of Guinea.  "The expatriates have been transferred temporarily to their home countries," Vale said in an emailed statement in Brazil.  "The local employees ... have been given leave from work until there is more accurate information about the risks of the disease."  There has not been any official statement from the chamber of mines but the executive said mining firms had been calling each other to discuss the best response. "People are locking down camps and keeping movements to a minimum," the executive added.  Neighbouring Senegal has closed its land borders with Guinea, and countries across the region have taken precautionary measures, including banning the sale and consumption of bats, a regional delicacy but an animal believed to be a vector for the virus.  The British Foreign Office said on its website on Wednesday there were reports of suspected cases in Gambia. But Gambia's director of health, promotion and education, Momadou Njai, denied there were any such infections, saying one elderly man had been tested and cleared. – Reuters  All material © Mail & Guardian Online.

Malac told the corporate group that teams from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization needed to get to southeastern Liberia, a largely undeveloped region of forests and rivers, far from most basic services. Finding safe accommodation posed a problem, and communications, transportation and logistics could also be difficult, she said.  The response was swift.  Within hours, David Rothschild, executive director of agribusiness firmÂ Golden Veroleum Liberia, which has palm oil operations in the countryâs southeast, offered housing he described as clean but ârudimentaryâ in two counties, Sinoe and Grand Kru.  William Cook, operations director of gold-mining companyHummingbird Resources, offered housing in a guest house with electricity and running water â rare amenities in the remote region â near the town of Greenville and in an exploration camp further inland.  In neighboring Sierra Leone, U.S. acting ambassador Kathleen Fitzgibbons cited the need for road grading and site preparation for an Ebola treatment center in the iron-ore producing town of Lunsar, which would be operated by theÂ International Medical Corps. Within hours,Â London Mining, with heavy equipment available, came to the rescue, cutting weeks or more from the construction process.  The prompt corporate response is the result of a months-long preparatory process to coordinate actions that began with aggressive programs information and education programs. Since March, when the Ebola threat re-emerged in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, after a relatively small rural outbreak earlier in the year, companies with operations in the area had been preparing for an emerging crisis. By monthâs end, the disease had spread to Guineaâs capital Conakry and was on the move through Liberia.

Sierra Leone last month recorded five deaths from Ebola, its first confirmed fatalities from an outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever that has is believed to have killed around 185 people in neighboring Guinea and Liberia since March.   London Mining said its output had not been affected and no cases of Ebola had been found in communities around the mine.   But a spokesman for the company, which operates the Marampa mine some 120 km (75 miles) east of Freetown, said eight non-essential staff had left Sierra Leone at the weekend and those abroad on holiday had been advised not to return for now.   “The company has also restricted non-essential travel and all such travels are approved by the managing director of London Mining,” Osman Lahai said.   London Mining also advised employees who are able to work remotely that they can do so.   A spokesman for African Minerals, another British iron ore miner in the West African state, said it had also introduced travel restrictions on workers but operations were otherwise unaffected.   Both firms said they had put in place systems to screen the body temperatures of people working on their sites.   An Ebola outbreak began earlier this year in Guinea's remote southeast, spreading later to Guinea's capital, Conakry, and into neighboring Liberia. Until last month, suspected cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone had tested negative.   The confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone have all been located close to the border with Guinea's Gueckedou prefecture, near the epicenter of the regional outbreak.   Theo Nicol, Sierra Leone's deputy information minister, said the government was doing everything it could to fight the disease and all cases in the capital, Freetown, had tested negative so far.   Underscoring the challenges tackling a highly contagious disease with a fatality rate of up to 90 percent in countries with some of the weakest health systems in the world, relatives of an Ebola patient in Sierra Leone took her home saying they did not trust the care she was given.   Sierra Leone began exporting iron ore in 2011, fuelling economic growth and highlighting the flood of investment into the country during the decade since its civil war ended.   However, Sierra Leone remains one of the world's poorest and least developed countries, and there is widespread frustration that despite the mining boom, more than half of the population of 6 million lives on less than $1.25 per day. http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-staff-at-uk-miner-leave-sierra-leone-due-to-ebola-virus-/1928752.html

One thing that has received little attention is the impactof the unprecedented Ebola epidemic on the area's economy.  A report by the World Bank suggests thefollowing:  Short-term impact on theeconomy (2014):  Guinea - growth reducedfrom 4.5 percent to 2.1 percent Liberia - growth reducedfrom 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent Sierra Leone - growthreduced from 11.3 percent to 8.0 percent  In total, $359 millionworth of output will be lost during 2014 by all three nations combined.  If the epidemic is notcontained by the end of December 2014, a scenario that appears to be quitelikely, there will be a medium-term impact on the economies of all threenations for the calendar year 2015.  The World Bank ran two scenarios; a"Low Ebola" scenario where there is rapid containment in the threecore nations and a "High Ebola" scenario where the containment in thethree core nations is slower and the epidemic spreads to a wider region and for a longer period of time.  Here is a chart showingthe medium-term impact on the economy for both Low and High Ebola scenarios inpercentage points of GDP:     In total, the negativeimpact to GDP for the three nations in 2015 is expected to be $97 million underLow Ebola and $890 million under High Ebola.  In this posting, I'mgoing to focus on the impact of the Ebola epidemic on Liberia, the nation thathas suffered the most deaths thus far.  Here is a map showing the latestdeath count, current to September 22, 2014, the latest date that the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has provided us with mapped data:

Sierra Leone last month recorded five deaths from Ebola, its first confirmed fatalities from an outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever that has is believed to have killed around 185 people in neighboring Guinea and Liberia since March.   London Mining said its output had not been affected and no cases of Ebola had been found in communities around the mine.   But a spokesman for the company, which operates the Marampa mine some 120 km (75 miles) east of Freetown, said eight non-essential staff had left Sierra Leone at the weekend and those abroad on holiday had been advised not to return for now.   “The company has also restricted non-essential travel and all such travels are approved by the managing director of London Mining,” Osman Lahai said.   A spokesman for African Minerals, another British iron ore miner in the West African state, said it had also introduced travel restrictions on workers but operations were otherwise unaffected.   Both firms said they had put in place systems to screen the body temperatures of people working on their sites.   An Ebola outbreak began earlier this year in Guinea’s remote southeast, spreading later to Guinea’s capital, Conakry, and into neighboring Liberia. Until last month, suspected cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone had tested negative.   The confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone have all been located close to the border with Guinea’s Gueckedou prefecture, near the epicenter of the regional outbreak.   Theo Nicol, Sierra Leone’s deputy information minister, said the government was doing everything it could to fight the disease and all cases in the capital, Freetown, had tested negative so far.   Underscoring the challenges tackling a highly contagious disease with a fatality rate of up to 90 percent in countries with some of the weakest health systems in the world, relatives of an Ebola patient in Sierra Leone took her home saying they did not trust the care she was given.   Sierra Leone began exporting iron ore in 2011, fuelling economic growth and highlighting the flood of investment into the country during the decade since its civil war ended.   However, Sierra Leone remains one of the world’s poorest and least developed countries, and there is widespread frustration that despite the mining boom, more than half of the population of 6 million lives on less than $1.25 per day.

The country plans to open the Development Bank of Nigeriain the next six to nine months. The lender will initially becapitalized with $2 billion, a figure that may rise to as muchas $10 billion, and fill a gap in Nigerian business lending, theminister said.  “It’s very difficult for businesspeople, especially smalland medium-sized enterprises, to find any money for five years,seven years,” she said. “Mostly they can borrow for a year tothree years. If you want to build a business sustainably and youwant your economy to have sustained growth you’ve got to fixaccess to finance.”  The development bank will be partly financed by theNigerian government, and is also due to receive $500 millioneach from the World Bank and the African Development Bank, and acredit line from the German development bank, KfW Group, shesaid.  “It’s going to be strong and get rated,” she said.
