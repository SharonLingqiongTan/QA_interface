Program manager Gill Pratt launched the DRC in response to another disaster  the triple meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011.  According to Pratt  both the ongoing Fukushima crisis and the Ebola outbreak point to a big gap between what we wish robots could do and what they actually can do. The machines competing in the DRC may look like a capable  even deadly  bunch  but theyre just babies when it comes to doing things for themselves  which is the whole point of disaster robots.

Tennessee-based  Lumalier Corp.  for example  already has two sanitation robots deployed in Liberia that are tasked with automatically decontaminating hospital rooms with ultraviolet light to destroy viruses. Disinfecting technology is already in use in U.S. hospitals so there's no denying it works.  While robots can indeed take the place of humans in many ways to ultimately prevent infection  using them in the field also has challenges. For one  only robots that can be sterilized with gases and heat can be used. Most robots are typically built using delicate components and this can hamper their use in affected countries in West Africa.  ,ebola-03a6a51151c701259fc11464c9137687f98d95a16a44f178dacd41dfea66930b,0,807,4,2016-04-15 08:26:46.564868,

Perhaps the best example of how a robot can be useful is cleaning up and decontaminating a room that has had Ebola patients in it  and has a lot of contaminated stuff in it.

Scratch the surface  though  and you can start to see the moral and philosophical questions that arise once robots start doing more than just grunt-level decontamination work. In short  everything changes once robots also become human-like caregivers of Ebola patients rather than just repurposed industrial robots. Even assuming that wise and highly moral technologists have created robots according to something approximating Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics  there still exists all kinds of potential for things to go wrong as robots go about trying to observe these laws.

You see  thereâs almost nothing that a human can do (task-wise) that robo-replacements canât: food and medicine delivery  body burials  even disinfecting contaminated areas.  The wheeled robots would come along with attached sprayers to decontaminate equipment.

I was a little bit skeptical about it  the idea that robots could somehow be employed to deal with this crisis in a way that would protect human beings. Is that realistic at this point?  JOHN HOLDREN: Well  in fact  we are having a workshop  my office  the Office of Science and Technology Policy  and a number of other partners on November 7 on potential uses of robots in the Ebola challenge.  Perhaps the best example of how a robot can be useful is cleaning up and decontaminating a room that has had Ebola patients in it  and has a lot of contaminated stuff in it. Obviously  if you could have a robot do that  and do it effectively  it would be safer than having a human being dealing with all of that contaminated waste and mess.  MILES O’BRIEN: But are robots really ready for that?  JOHN HOLDREN: I think they probably are.  I mean  you would be amazed at what robots can now do. You know  we have robots being developed that can fight fires and go into dangerous fire situations that you wouldn’t want to send a human fireman into. We can certainly — we can certainly make a robot that can decontaminate a room.  (,ebola-cd95c5a07a8e50ac41b6f06798a9a3b10afee21f2a07a54039e680004b7d1161,0,1219,3,2016-05-10 13:34:47.310368,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,369,Robots,100,Medical Robots,9904,Ultraviolet radiation from the sun can be important for Ebola prevention and treatment. The Ebola virus is inactivated when it is exposed to UV radiation. [19] UV light is contained in unfiltered natural sunlight and is available from manmade sources. The Ebola virus can survive in liquid or dried material for a number of days once it leaves the body of the host. [20] This means that hygiene is important for preventing the spread of the virus.  Health Engineers have actually developed a UV robot that can be sent into an area that might contain viruses and/or bacteria and completely disinfect the environment in 2 minutes. This means that high risk environments for Ebola transmission could be easily treated every day if needed.

1,Ebola,2,assr2,369,Robots,100,Medical Robots,9917,The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently organized a symposium of top robotics experts at Worcester Polytechnic Institute to brainstorm how field robots could be used in future Ebola-like pandemics. While the researchers came up with a number of innovative short-term and long-term ideas for how robots could be used to fight Ebola – everything from cleaning and decontaminating rooms to actually administering IVs to humans under medical treatment — there are still a number of important issues to clarify before we hand over the task of fighting Ebola to the robots.  On the surface  of course  handing over the dirty work of cleaning up after an Ebola outbreak to the robots sounds like a no-brainer. Instead of putting humans into harm’s way  why not just send in a robot? Robots can’t develop symptoms from Ebola  they are relatively easy to disinfect (except for their wheels)  they dutifully carry out tasks without talking back and they can dispose of hazardous waste efficiently.  Scratch the surface  though  and you can start to see the moral and philosophical questions that arise once robots start doing more than just grunt-level decontamination work. In short  everything changes once robots also become human-like caregivers of Ebola patients rather than just repurposed industrial robots. Even assuming that wise and highly moral technologists have created robots according to something approximating Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics  there still exists all kinds of potential for things to go wrong as robots go about trying to observe these laws. Just read any of Asimov’s “Robot” stories  (or  better yet  watch the Will Smith movie) to understand how things might go awry.  ,ebola-9da9f2499959d81c26babd1bfd6ae607f2e115fecbb2d2b2be840b2aead490f0,0,1724,4,2016-05-10 14:26:20.768263,

They have been honoured for their "tireless acts of courage and mercy"  having risked their lives to fight the deadly Ebola virus that's killed more than 6 000 people worldwide.  And if trials underway in the United States prove to be successful  these healthcare workers on the frontlines of the Ebola epidemic could be joined by life-saving robots.  Meet Flash  the robot with the power to kill viruses and the potential to save lives. Flash resembles a skinnier version of R2D2 from Star Wars.  Doctors at Los Robles hospital in Southern California - where Flash has been deployed in a medical trial - welcome this latest warrior in their constant fight against infectious diseases.  Dr Barry Statner  an infectious disease specialist at Los Robles Hospital  said: "Whenever a patient leaves  we use him as part of the terminal cleaning process  so that between patients the room is cleansed and disinfected and he is part of the disinfecting process."  In Sierra Leone  one of the areas worst hit by the current Ebola outbreak  an army of protective hazmat suits are being used  but this robot technology replaces the need for human cleaning.  Ebola can survive outside the human body on exposed surfaces for weeks. But Xenex - the makers of Flash - say the virus does not stand a chance against ultra-violent light.  Xenex sales director  Steve Huff  said: "Ebola is actually a fairly easy organism to kill. It is a virus so it's very susceptible to the UV light. So Ebola takes about 90 seconds to deactivate."  ,ebola-6cc0ffe619ea65f0a98bd71c3577713cf457cd6a2e2bc1821a01ef5e56c8cee2,0,1604,3,2016-05-10 14:58:10.315152,

It's something we saw in the extreme following 9/11 with ex-Homeland Security head Michael Chertoff and others who raked in the spoils from their revolving door into private sector security tech. The fact is: fear does pay . . . and now we've got enhanced patdowns  screenings  drones and robots in common use and becoming more prevalent with each passing threat.  So perhaps it was inevitable that an Ebola-killing robot would be offered up as a logical solution to this latest outbreak.

It's something we saw in the extreme following 9/11 with ex-Homeland Security head Michael Chertoff and others who raked in the spoils from their revolving door into private sector security tech. The fact is: fear does pay . . . and now we've got enhanced patdowns  screenings  drones and robots in common use and becoming more prevalent with each passing threat.  So perhaps it was inevitable that an Ebola-killing robot would be offered up as a logical solution to this latest outbreak. Great news for the developer  Xenex  whose CEO Morris Miller appears literally breathless in the following clip from FOX's Opening Bell segment. At a $134 000 a unit  no wonder.

Actually  Medical News Daily reported that Xenex’s germ-zapping robots are already being used at 250 hospitals across the United States. The germ-zapping pieces of medical technology emit ultraviolet rays that are approximately 25 000 times brighter than our sun. Xenex’s machine sends out 1.5 pulses each second  and covers a radius of up to 10 feet. These germ-zapping robots destroy germs  including viruses like Ebola  on any surface within the working radius in just minutes.  “The spread of these infections  such as MRSA and C. diff  already result in tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. annually ” the San Antonio Business Journal reported this week. So  while Ebola is the headlined scare of the season  the Xenex technology can prevent deaths due to hospital acquired diseases sweeping the nation by eliminating risks of hospital transmission in the first place.  “Eliminating pathogens from patient rooms is the quickest and easiest way to lower the risk of additional infections ” Dr. Mark Stibich  chief scientific officer and co-founder of Xenex  explained in a statement. “Our customers report in peer-reviewed  published studies that after using our patented germ-zapping robots to disinfect surfaces  they experienced significant reductions in hospital acquired infections. That’s because our devices are faster  more effective  and easier to use than mercury-based UV room disinfection systems.”  Xenex promises that its germ-zapping robots can eradicate the Ebola virus on surfaces in two minutes  and other serious infectious diseases within five minutes. Current mercury-based systems are said to be more dangerous  and can take up to an hour to sanitize surfaces.  The CDC says that Ebola can remain viable for transmission for up to six days on surfaces  but compared to other viruses  Ebola is very sensitive to ultraviolet light  which happens to be the way the Xenex robots work. The company’s studies in real hospitals seem to support efficacy claims about the germ-zapping robot.  ,ebola-21c69afb935794273c10f80a3afc172b142362b00069a62b57ff3859b2cbe699,0,2276,3,2016-05-11 07:47:28.515156,

According to a spokesperson from Xenex  the robot  mounted on wheels for easy transport  emits the UV light which pulsates through a two to three-meter radius for about five minutes to disinfect the area.  Created by an inventor from Alamo City  the device named "Little Moe" was first made commercially available in 2010 and now costs a minimum of US$104 000.  ,ebola-dce0ac7636120574e5cdd9296082c87400b534d9ce1b4e25f82a276d3dabb144,0,936,3,2016-05-11 07:52:09.254331, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,369,Robots,100,Medical Robots,10073,Now  a ray-gun toting robot may be coming to the rescue.  A nurse in Spain contracted Ebola from a patient she cared for. Thomas Eric Duncan lies in critical condition in isolation at a Dallas hospital  but health officials have had trouble finding a company to decontaminate his apartment.  Schools where Enterovirus-68 cases have cropped up are being disinfected  but the job is hard to do thoroughly and workers could be placed at risk.  The solution could be something out of a science fiction movie  a robot that pulses high intensity ultra violet light to kill microscopic invaders. That is how some hospitals are waging war against deadly  drug resistant bacteria and viruses.  “Because these new kinds of bacteria  they are not only antibiotic resistant  but they can teach other bacteria how to be resistant in the same way they are  rendering many of our antibiotics useless ” Hospital Administrator  Steve Sullivan said.  Even after a patient has been discharged and their room is cleaned  studies have shown that as much as 50-percent of patient surfaces are still contaminated and could put another patient at risk.  The Xenex robot shoots hi-intensity pulses of ultraviolet-c light to do the job that even cleaning solutions can’t.  “When UV hits a bacterial cell wall it does damage to the cell wall and it also fries the DNA of the bacteria or the virus and so it can’t reproduce and it dies ” Xenex Technical Director  Rachael Sparks explained.  ,ebola-d99d6dd1b1d12c52d7708d56f64e4686a86135c0d771837d833e0ef584b4442a,0,1463,3,2016-05-11 07:53:02.282153,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,369,Robots,100,Medical Robots,10095,Reader Michigan alerted me to a recent news story about a robotic machine that can eradicate the Ebola virus from surfaces in about two minutes. It’s a bit pricey  but considering how much the government wastes every year on ridiculous studies and other totally wasteful projects  you would think they could find the money to produce a few more of these things. Not only does it kill Ebola  but other dangerous viruses and bacteria as well. You would think this is something the government would want to see in every US hospital  but that would require common sense.  The robot rolls around on four wheels and uses xenon  a non-toxic gas  to create the ultraviolet rays needed to destroy viruses.  It blasts 1.5 pulses per second up to ten feet (three metres) in every direction to kill viruses including Ebola.  Light that is 25 000 times bright than sunlight is created in each flash.  The robot was first made available in 2010 and each unit costs Â£65 000 ($104 000).  ‘Our robot ensures the room is safe for the next patient by destroying germs on high-touch surfaces  and in hard to clean nooks and crannies ’ a spokesperson for Xenex said.  Ebola  however  is actually easier to kill than other infectious diseases such as superbugs that mutate and become immune to disinfection.  It takes just two minutes for the robot to destroy Ebola on a surface  while other viruses can be eradicated in five minutes.  Such technology  using UV rays to sterilise a room  has been around for decades  but Little Moe speeds up the process by using xenon in place of mercury.

The Xenex unit generates UV light using xenon -- one of the noble gases -- rather than toxic mercury. So there's no toxic mercury to deal with  even when disposing of the equipment after its useful life.  So many of the approaches to disinfection in hospitals today are based on harsh  toxic chemicals that pose a secondary risk to the health of hospital patients and staff. But UV light emitted by the Xenex robot leaves no chemical residue whatsoever and requires no chemical manufacturing plant to manufacture.

The number of confirmed and suspected Ebola cases reported in the week preceding 8Â October (854) is more than twice the total number of cases confirmed in the largest previous outbreak  which lasted around four months  beginning in late 2000.   Past outbreaks of Ebola were stopped while they were still in rural areas.

The disease that was localized in a rural setting  scaled in a space of four months to become a national crisis. Given that the virus started in rural areas  there is reason to believe that it will impact on agriculture  especially when it came at a time when agricultural season was at its peak. ,ebola-e250c7f79449be002644e052ed0e9de39dbf40beeb12d3cb88e90270ed9bccc3,0,411,3,2016-04-15 12:56:59.073607,

It is thought to be transmitted from fruit bats to wild animals  which in turn pass it on to livestock and so to humans.  Ebola is not an airborne illness such as flu. It is spread from one human to another through contact with bodily fluids. This means the disease can spread quickly through village communities  but finds it more difficult to transmit to urban areas.  ,ebola-ee475a6a9be9c6f65556f750ca2edac4bc0840e6e2c67744e1cf4427646f89f4,0,403,3,2016-04-15 13:10:40.695206,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,376,Urbanisation/Urbanization,115,Movement,1782,Originally  this outbreak spread because of ritual burial practices that brought people into contact with fluids from dead bodies. Is that still a primary source of transmission?  It is an issue. With urbanization  you have people who are moving into urban areas who are not completely divorced from the practices they had in the rural areas. They're recent transplants and they carry with them that culture.  ,ebola-be332e989cfb18ff0767d220c1ceff76c910f68f678b686eb59a887eecea7fc5,0,410,4,2016-04-18 07:46:21.186494,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,376,Urbanisation/Urbanization,115,Movement,1787,Ebola's rapid spread also owes much to West Africa's Malthusian humandemographics. In 1950  most the region's poor (some 70 million) lived in rural areas. Today they are concentrated in chaotic urban slums. The region's 317 million will soon become a half billion by mid-century due to some of the world's highest fertility rates.  Ebola  of course  can be contained in isolated rural communities. More than a dozen previous outbreaks  which all appeared in remote areas  were stopped cold because the virus ran either out of hosts  or healthcare workers stopped human-to-human spread by changing localfuneral practices.  But in Africa's crowded and hungry megacities  the virus has won untold entrepreneurial advantages. Tracing infected individuals in some of the world's fastest-growing slums is a nightmare. ,ebola-802d358037647973ed748e3d80ddf31ad4ad2e44c670aecc13109de8c3a1c84f,0,812,4,2016-04-18 07:51:19.781396,

Sierra Leoneâs growth rate has been cut by 1 percent  Campbell said  and more severe economic and political consequences are possible.  The three countries affected are going through an extremely rapid period of urbanization  Campbell said. Liberia and Sierra Leone are emerging from lengthy civil wars  and rural villagers are packing into urban slums  making quarantine difficult.  If the epidemic spreads into Lagos  Nigeriaâs largest city and the second-fastest-growing city in Africa  it will have âdestabilizing consequences â Campbell said.  ,ebola-d8aafdc3ccea74595e2c011272e1c906b06ce6e7c9953b88daaf254fc2e81dd9,0,750,4,2016-04-18 08:00:41.650970, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,376,Urbanisation/Urbanization,115,Movement,1803,Infectious disease specialists were able to trace the current Ebola epidemic back to its first patient â what epidemiologists call the âsentinel caseâ â a two-year-old child in the Guinean village of Meliandou  in GuÃ©ckÃ©dou province in the far north-eastern corner of the country. The epidemic spiraled out of control  partly because it made its way to densely populated urban areas  where it had never been seen in previous epidemics  dating from 1976.  The earliest and hardest hit was in Liberiaâs capital of Monrovia  but it also spread to Guineaâs capital and largest urban center  Conakry  as well as to Freetown  the capital of Sierra Leone. Why? One plausible reason is urbanization and modernization that have promoted the flow of people and goods from rural areas to cities.  ,ebola-8aec1699cfaf1b1e1ca8a71f0756ca33b9fdbf39907acca7cc0e5a1676741e2e,0,800,4,2016-04-18 08:03:29.863745,

"One of the most distinguishing features in this outbreak is that it involves cities " said Daniel Lucey  adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at ‎Georgetown University Medical Center. "When outbreaks were rural  they were easier to control—you could quarantine people who were sick and stop the outbreak.... When it got into three capital cities  it became harder to control."  The move to urban centers make it far easier for the virus to spread more quickly and over far greater distances  due to increased transportation access and higher population density.  ,ebola-85a487ec84b59f43377b7d2586bc4927bc8aacf64559f2bea0844fe1a35c9cef,0,664,3,2016-04-18 08:06:25.845557,

So this is more reassuring  there's been this rather alarmist speculation that the virus is mutating and that other modes of spreading might occur. This has not occurred  the virus has not mutated. So we're dealing with the same virus  that has occurred in all the other outbreaks caused by Ebola Zaire. What we would love to learn is more how transmission is occurring in this urban setting. We're speculating that the same person-to-person contact is occurring  but the people are now getting in taxis and driving for hours and hours not being able to find a treatment center.

First  residents of the affected countries — Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone — travel much farther and have many more contacts than they did in previous decades. Following up on all contacts who live a few miles from a case is much easier than tracking down people who may live far away.  With modern transportation  family members may travel hundreds of miles to be with sick loved ones. And more of this outbreak area  in West Africa  is urbanized than where many of the previous outbreaks occurred in Central Africa  so the virus spreads faster.  ,ebola-5850de8fc53d9b336d53d4131f0fa1d91e918327963dbf12fb34ea7ed965b10c,0,641,4,2016-04-18 09:01:41.746768,

The rapid move to urbanization could give Ebola whole new urban populations to attack. African cities like Lagos  Nairobi  Kinshasa  Mogadishu  Johannesburg  and Cape Town could all be at risk.

Due to constant population movements  the separation of adults from children  the dislocation of healers from traditional sources of herbs and medicines  and the post-conflict experience of urbanization  traditional medicine in Liberia is no longer traditional  nor is it medicine. As I demonstrate in my book Searching for Normal in the Wake of the Liberian War  the war  and the post-war social changes that followed  fundamentally disrupted the process of inter-generational education and transmission of customary healing knowledge. As a result  people who arrive at a hospital in Monrovia are as likely to die from their “traditional remedy” as they are to be killed by the failures of the medical system.  ,ebola-c6099abc11827a08e26f05a3bf89ebc8c8c593e4bd921aad6be277654f872daf,0,812,2,2016-04-25 12:49:52.302009,

"When outbreaks were rural  they were easier to control—you could quarantine people who were sick and stop the outbreak.... When it got into three capital cities  it became harder to control."  The move to urban centers make it far easier for the virus to spread more quickly and over far greater distances  due to increased transportation access and higher population density.  ,ebola-85a487ec84b59f43377b7d2586bc4927bc8aacf64559f2bea0844fe1a35c9cef,0,664,3,2016-04-25 13:26:21.209030,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,376,Urbanisation/Urbanization,115,Movement,5339,Human exposure to these hosts and their habitats increases with a number of ecological factors related to the destruction and alteration of this habitat. These changes both make it easier for a human population to be infected  and for the virus to spread through populations of humans. Such factors include uncontrolled urbanization and the intrusion of domestic animals into tropical forests; deforestation and the creation of new boundaries between forests  and farms and transportation routes; primitive irrigation systems and dams  creating places of standing water; new routes for migrating birds because of water pollution and deforestation; more long-distance livestock transportation; and more long-distance air travel. Thus trends in increasing human globalization also lead to a greater vulnerability to epidemics of Ebola and other viruses.  ,ebola-aaa367474f1138657c91a2906d86fbccf8dd4a244627df979cbbaa5b0a74ad78,0,853,2,2016-04-25 14:01:54.955590,

For those subject to controlled movement  travel by long-distance commercial conveyances (e.g.  aircraft  ship  bus  train) should not be allowed; if travel is allowed  it should be by noncommercial conveyance such as private chartered flight or private vehicle  and occur with arrangements for uninterrupted active monitoring. Federal public health travel restrictions (Do Not Board) may be used to enforce controlled movement. For people subject to controlled movement  use of local public transportation (e.g.  bus  subway) should be discussed with and only occur with approval of the local public health authority. ,ebola-8907c6cbf1f7ebb891da7e8bdb3f16cfbe7e115fcbc7ed018482f879ba6e8d40,0,895,2,2016-05-09 12:54:08.025602,

In the past  village outbreaks remained small  unless people went to hospitals.

1,Ebola,2,assr2,376,Urbanisation/Urbanization,115,Movement,8786,Ebola in a rural setting often follows the predictions of these models reasonably well because there is not a lot of movement in and out of the population. However  there are a lot of ways for an outbreak to defy the typical course the model predicts. On one hand  public health intervention can decrease the amount of contact people have with each other and improve people’s immunity through vaccines or drugs. On the other hand  having people travel and take the illness with them to other areas can prolong it. The current Ebola outbreak is much more complex than these basic models.

He made the statement Thursday in an interview with the Liberia News Agency (LINA) at the compound of the Church of Praise in Logan Town  Bushrod Island.   Alternative care is the process where an orphan is placed under direct care and supervision of a close relative or next of kin so that they can be properly monitored as they grow up.   Kolee told LINA that alternative care is also necessary because it prevents an orphan from experiencing ill treatment and abuse as their caregivers will be supported and supervised directly by government.   ,ebola-a78f317014a8ab2f75d02410a018a1e067311f2b7f8aef1435d045afad963d9d,0,924,4,2016-05-04 10:41:56.869051,

A sprawling slum of the country’s war-ravaged capital  Monrovia  it is home to 50 000 people  and has next to no functioning lavatories  sinks or bathrooms. Sewage runs openly through its maze of corrugated shacks  and in Liberia’s wet season – at its height right now – tropical torrents turn it into one vast  warm  moist  breeding pool for germs.  It hardly feels surprising then  in the wake of several locals dying from Ebola  to see health teams daubing blue crosses on a number of shacks around town.  These  however  are not to identify those who have caught the disease  but to mark the relatively few New Kru Towners who have been visited by the teams and accepted their advice on how to avoid getting it. So far  only around 500 houses have been marked – and with health workers themselves accused of spreading the disease  some parts of New Kru Town remain decidedly hostile…  ,ebola-64da2f697fc2dd8e4c66f790322aeeb20db5106f01077434a4401acb4783336f,0,999,2,2016-05-06 09:55:56.010121,

Those who don’t have a “commode” in their house are forced to defecate outside—so many that the government of Liberia recently banned adults from doing so on the beach  though not children.  As the Ebola epidemic began sweeping through the region  fear and mistrust of the health workers in West Point escalated. Four days after a mob overtook an isolation center in August  President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf ordered a mandatory 21-day quarantine on the area. But the quarantine  lifted just 10 days in  was a colossal failure. On top of inciting violence that led to the death of a 16-year-old boy  it was confusing to residents.

There have been reports of live rounds being shot into the crowds  while authorities are trying to contain an Ebola outbreak in a densely populated city. As I've written before  there are reasons why the residents of West Point  and many other Liberians  are resisting efforts to contain the outbreak. It is easy to blame the residents for not accepting the actions of health workers  especially when centuries of racism have characterized citizens of African nations as unintelligent  violent  and dirty. However  it is not an inherent fault in the residents of West Point that is fueling their anger. Their reactions are a result of living in extreme poverty  without public health education that would teach them about Ebola  and without the trust that comes from consistent access to healthcare.   ,ebola-da850757931e883981ace85b125d3e459e8396dae7b96117d90f218b5ddd63b8,0,842,2,2016-05-06 08:52:18.687922,

Desperately in need of maps that would be useful in understanding population distribution  the organization turned to Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team  which coordinated a crowdsourcing effort to produce the first digital map of Guéckédou  a city of around 250 000 people in southern Guinea.   ,ebola-57652b3f3c2f2bebb48973ad983c3e802ff5640ade09fc8bac66c60641ff3eac,0,579,2,2016-04-19 09:10:50.583655,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,396,Crowdfunding Crowdsourcing,171,Mapping,2550,Google Maps is so comprehensive that you can use it to plan a New York City subway trip down to the minute. But in the parts of West Africa affected by the Ebola epidemic  Google barely has the roads mapped out. More often than not  the names of villages are missingâand sometimes the village altogether.  "Google's business model is selling advertising  so it's simply the business case " says Andrew Buck  a volunteer coordinator with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. "Starbucks isn't paying for Google to advertise over there so there's very little incentive for Google to improve its maps."  Organizations working in the three hardest-hit countries  Sierra Leone  Guinea  and Liberia  need doctors and medical equipment. But they also need something more basic: maps to help aid workers get around the country and do the difficult job of checking village by village for victims of the disease.  That's why organizations like the UN  Red Cross  and Doctors Without Borders have turned to OpenStreetMap (OSM) for their map data. Commonly referred to as the "Wikipedia for maps " OSM is a crowdsourced mapping project that brings together mappers on the ground using GPS devices with map editors working remotely.  A subset of the OSM community  the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has taken on creating more robust maps of the affected countries in West Africa. HOT is a specialized team that responds to international humanitarian crises by corralling OSM volunteers to gear their efforts to impacted areas.  Using free and open source software designed by them specifically for this purpose  HOT has been able to produce detailed  freely available maps.  ,ebola-de51ed6b0cafd067307e79ab29fdedd8bf3e25ceb70f7142ffc2b8d43fd954ba,0,1671,4,2016-04-19 10:09:31.491556,

After Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) arrived in Guinea last month  they found only topographical maps  which had no information about population density. They then asked the digital mapping organization Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to create the first building-by-building maps of the area based on satellite imagery. Here's how it worked out  as New Scientist reports.  Mathieu Soupart  who leads technical support for MSF operations  says his organisation started using the maps right away to pinpoint where infected people were coming from and work out how the virus  which had killed 95 people in Guinea when New Scientist went to press  is spreading. "Having very detailed maps with most of the buildings is very important  especially when working door to door  house by house " he says. The maps also let MSF chase down rumours of infection in surrounding hamlets  allowing them to find their way through unfamiliar terrain.  ,ebola-9727abeb93678a1d9eb33f9cfd0d83eb602f549c3981b814bc0db480731a3602,0,1049,4,2016-04-19 12:43:01.335611,

A current glitch in using this platform is that the MicroMappers website has only been open for volunteers to contribute to just a couple times since it went live.

Infection of endothelial cells also induces a cytopathic effect and damage to the endothelial barrier that  together with cytokine effects  leads to the loss of vascular integrity (B). Transient expression of Ebola virus GP in human umbilical vein endothelial cells or 293T cells causes a reduction of specific integrins (primary molecules responsible for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix) and immune molecules on the cell surface.

Martin-Moreno  MD  PhD  DrPH  from the University of Valencia in Spain  and colleagues looked at the potential use of excessive precautions in response to Ebola. Noting that the primary mode of transmission of Ebola virus is through direct and indirect contact with infected patients' secretions  and that transmission is rarely via an airborne route  the authors questioned the need for complete respiratory protection.  The researchers contend that systematic application of precautionary measures to protect from direct contact are sufficient for management of most patients (who do not experience hemorrhage or vomiting). Goggles and masks may be unnecessary for speaking to conscious patients if a minimum distance of one to two meters is maintained. Exceptional precautions should be reserved for interventions that generate aerosols or for use in laboratories where the virus is cultured. In most settings where the virus is rampant  they are unnecessary. Rational and efficient use of protective equipment is needed in western African  and this can be achieved by communication of a consistent message that disease transmission is via direct contact.

Using a virtual research technology invented by Chematria  a startup housed at U of T's Impact Centre  the team will use software that learns and thinks like a human chemist to search for new medicines. Running on Canada's most powerful supercomputer  the effort will simulate and analyze the effectiveness of millions of hypothetical drugs in just a matter of weeks.  "What we are attempting would have been considered science fiction  until now " says Abraham Heifets (PhD)  a U of T graduate and the chief executive officer of Chematria. "We are going to explore the possible effectiveness of millions of drugs  something that used to take decades of physical research and tens of millions of dollars  in mere days with our technology."  Chematria's technology is a virtual drug discovery platform based on the science of deep learning neural networks and has previously been used for research on malaria  multiple sclerosis  C. difficile  and leukemia.  Much like the software used to design airplanes and computer chips in simulation  this new system can predict the possible effectiveness of new medicines  without costly and time-consuming physical synthesis and testing. The system is driven by a virtual brain that teaches itself by "studying" millions of datapoints about how drugs have worked in the past. With this vast knowledge  the software can apply the patterns it has learned to predict the effectiveness of hypothetical drugs  and suggest surprising uses for existing drugs  transforming the way medicines are discovered.  ,ebola-4a483bf3b4eb99b1d1822b7bccf198265a952fa49087bf1bc89fe71759c65a9e,0,1664,2,2016-04-27 09:20:59.599679,

When pressed  the caller says he is from a famous charity’s chapter in the Bronx  New York. BBB Metro New York confirmed that no such branch exists and that the solicitation is likely a scam.  BBB warns donors to carefully research any charitable efforts - especially those that surface following an event that gains media attention.    Tips* on funding requests appearing on crowdfunding sites:  See if the crowdfunding request is from a charity. If so  check out the organization at give.org  the charity reporting arm of the BBB. Give to individuals you know. It is safest to give to those individuals you personally know who are contacting you to support their specific crowdfunding project. Crowdfunding projects that share updates provide greater transparency. Updates from a project's organizers help to ensure they're being honest about the uses of raised money. Don't assume your donation or gift is tax deductible. If you are funding a project run by an individual instead of a charity  the funding you provide may not be deductible as a charitable gift for federal income tax purposes. Read the fine print. There could be credit card fees and administrative costs associated with donating on a crowdfunding site. Specialized crowdfunding sites (for example  a site that focuses on relief projects in other countries) may be more adept. A site that allows any type of crowdfunding may result in more challenging oversight hurdles. ,ebola-766720aee67ac27e042965103435253b3f2de0fab132299112d4258acf5c383c,0,1561,3,2016-05-11 09:10:46.608831,

The growing ebola crisis in west Africa has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Global Concern by the World Health Organization with a death toll exceeding 1 000 victims.  OS2966 is a monoclonal antibody drug candidate being investigated in multiple models of highly aggressive cancers. OS2966 inhibits CD29  a major cellular adhesion receptor fundamental to cancer progression. Coincidentally  it is also thought CD29  which is highly enriched in the bodyâs normal blood vessels  is hijacked by the ebola virus during infection. The proposed studies will examine whether OS2966 can block ebola infection in cultured human vascular cells.  â,ebola-c77101b6f4720d098351dc9ca8c22f8b0735cc72960d313a6e239d5de09f6788,0,827,3,2016-05-11 12:12:20.529866,

Epidemic dynamics in each of Liberia  Sierra Leone  and Guinea were evolved via a discrete-time stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) 9 10 epidemic model (with timesteps of one day; details in Appendix 1)  and then the risk of entry into Australia was calculated based on the number of individuals flying into Australia from each of these countries (i.e.  irrespective of stopovers). All passenger data was compiled and provided by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection (www.immi.gov.au). Australia is one of the few countries in the world which is able to accurately measure the number of people entering and leaving the nation 20. This arises from Australiaâs global isolation and its island geography. With modern border surveillance systems this has meant that all movements into and out of the country are channelled through a relatively small number of sea and air ports  where there is an advanced electronic system to record their movements and some basic characteristics. These include: (i) their origin and destination; (ii) passenger status (i.e.  Australian resident  tourist  or immigrant); and (iii) whether it is a permanent  long term (one year or more  but temporary) or short term movement.  ,ebola-47144cb37c95694307783e228b551683e74bac10500fbc15fc0f3e918d444409,0,1404,4,2016-04-20 10:02:48.766778,

This includes:  Assessing the ability of these countries and airports to conduct exit screening Assisting with development of exit screening protocols Training staff on exit screening protocols and appropriate PPE useÂ  Training in-country staff to provide future trainings Exit screening efforts in West Africa help identify travelers who are sick with Ebola or who have been exposed to Ebola  to prevent them from leaving a country until it is confirmed that they are not sick with Ebola and are therefore not at risk of spreading Ebola.  During Travel  CDC works with international public health organizations  other federal agencies  and the travel industry to identify sick travelers arriving in the United States and to take public health actions to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. Airlines are required to report any deaths onboard or ill travelers meeting certain criteria to CDC before arriving into the United States  and CDC and its partners determine whether any public health action is needed. If a traveler is infectious or exhibiting symptoms during or after a flight  CDC will conduct an investigation of exposed travelers and work with the airline  federal partners  and state and local health departments to notify them and take any necessary public health action. When CDC receives a report of an ill traveler on a cruise or cargo ship  CDC officials work with the shipping line to make an assessment of public health risk and to coordinate any necessary response.  ,ebola-8b0feb19d6603b0e19f34deb410de2f4a6c95476748a2bf510008a2c0b06af8e,0,1761,3,2016-04-20 10:13:27.187018, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,398,Air and Sea Travel and Trade,177,US,3273,Dr Tom Frieden  director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  has tried to explain why he doesn’t support a travel ban:  Importantly  isolating countries won’t keep Ebola contained and away from American shores. Paradoxically  it will increase the risk that Ebola will spread in those countries and to other countries  and that we will have more patients who develop Ebola in the US. People will move between countries  even when governments restrict travel and trade. And that kind of travel becomes almost impossible to track.  Simply put: you can’t seal the country. If you blocked air travel  it would force desperate individuals to use alternative routes – over land and sea – to escape the epidemic. They’ll still end up in the US  except you won’t know where.  There are many reasons why a flight ban would be practically impossible to implement. For example  remember that Thomas Eric Duncan  the US patient who caught the Ebola virus in his native Liberia  flew to Texas via Brussels in Belgium. An effective ban would require international coordination. Would every nation agree to quarantine West Africa  to cripple their economy and choke them of humanitarian aid? Unlikely.  ,ebola-7c1f5bfdb9ee7a132c90e2f8a1da1c126bbaf4c77f0b5524f030efa1bf152d6c,0,1205,2,2016-04-20 10:28:24.993973, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,398,Air and Sea Travel and Trade,177,US,3293,Has the U.S. ever enforced that kind of a blanket travel ban?  Not really. The U.S. has not banned people from a certain country from coming to the U.S. because of an epidemic.  But President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did ban anyone infected with HIV/AIDS from entering in the United States. And for more than 20 years  that was U.S. government policy until President Barack Obama struck it down in 2009.  That travel ban came at a time when AIDS was heavily stigmatized in the United States and amid misinformation and some public fear that the disease could spread through casual contact.  Anyway  there's not much evidence to suggest that travel ban was successfully enforced or effective. Today  more than 1.1 million people are HIV positive.  ,ebola-0cb2ecb07bfb0c0e2ca6524864a433622d18d00b82d0109f61137bce7c3adcd2,0,744,1,2016-04-20 10:45:51.590050,

As of October 16  no travelers from Guinea  Liberia  Sierra Leone  the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria will be allowed to enter Belize. Speaking at a press conference Minister of Immigration Godwin Hulse stated that a ban from travelers from Texas where Ebola has been detected  had been considered but that there would be no practical way to do this. “It would be difficult to isolate one of the states of the United States ” he stated. “But we will scrutinize the passports of any individuals who may have traveled to areas in the U.S. where Ebola has been detected  and act accordingly”. The government has also imposed a travel ban for anyone who has visited West Africa 30 days before trying to enter Belize  be it by air  land or sea.    In the case of cruise ship passengers  all passports will now be carefully checked to see if they have ever traveled to West Africa.

No wonder in the last ten years we have seen ships plagued not only by outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases  noro virus and e-coli  but measles & rubella  Legionnaires Disease  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and other infectious diseases.  It's outlandish that the cruise industry has no protocols specifically related to Ebola to keep hospital workers who worked around Ebola the heck off of cruise ships.  And if this lack of preparation is any indication  I shudder to think how ill prepared the cruise ships are to respond if an outbreak occurs.  This afternoon  ABC News published a photo taken by a Carnival Magic cruise passenger Jeremy Malone who saw 30 to 40 crew with buckets of disinfectant to deal with the Ebola scare.

Passengers embarking on a cruise ship must fill out a health screening questionnaire  which has historically consisted of just two questions  one about fever combined with other flu-related symptoms (cough  sore throat  runny nose  etc.) and a second questions about vomiting and/or gastrointestinal distress. Under the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  cruise lines have added three new queries to the questionnaire. The new questions are designed to determine if a potential passenger has arrived directly from a country designated with a Level 3 Travel Health warning (hopefully we've explained what that is above) by the CDC or has traveled to  in or through such a country within 21 days before embarkation. These same questions are being put to crew. Additionally  the cruise lines are monitoring where the reservations are coming from  as well as passport nationality and visa information in booking and employment records. A third question  which was added to the form as of this past week  asks if embarking passengers (or crew members) have had physical contact with  or helped care for  a person with Ebola during the same time frame. If that's the case  passengers would be asked to submit to further medical screening before boarding.  ,ebola-d9c7e27494134cf3a0a666f7b3a5046c20d89bb58406c75b7143d2321de5861a,0,1348,3,2016-04-20 08:51:10.979232,

The Cruise Lines International Association  the industry's governmental lobbying group and travel agent educator  has provided CDC and WHO medical guidance on Ebola to the cruise lines to distribute to their medical teams. Additionally  CLIA has put together its own protocol using much of the CDC and WHO information that contains elements of preparedness and response and sample instructions for cruise line medical staff to follow. While this protocol doesn't require specialized  hands-on training  CLIA's director of environmental and health programs  Bud Darr  told Cruise Critic he is aware of a "substantial amount" of training going on  though he could not comment on specific lines. Cruise line medical teams already have received training in dealing  generally  with infectious disease and the use of isolation  as they are always on the lookout for â and treat when needed -- Norovirus  a highly contagious gastrointestinal illness. According to Roger Frizzell  senior vice president and chief communications officer for Carnival Corp.  the cruise industry is better prepared for Ebola than many because of its history in screening for and combating Norovirus.  ,ebola-d9c7e27494134cf3a0a666f7b3a5046c20d89bb58406c75b7143d2321de5861a,0,1255,3,2016-04-20 08:51:29.904930,

The pair boarded the ship on October 12 in Galveston  Texas.  The Carnival passenger is being treated as "very low risk " according to the State Department and Carnival. According to a Carnival statement: "At no point in time has the individual exhibited any symptoms or signs of infection  and it has been 19 days since she was in the lab with the testing samples. Â She is deemed by CDC to be very low risk. Â At this time  the guest remains in isolation on board the ship and is not deemed to be a risk to any guests or crew."  At the request of the U.S. government  Carnival Magic's doctor has examined and monitored both passengers  confirming they are and continue to be in good health. The incubation period for Ebola is up to 21 days. Ebola is transmitted only through contact with bodily fluids of an infected individual.  The State Department statement also confirmed it is working to bring the quarantined passengers back to the U.S.  "in an abundance of caution."  Carnival Magic  which left Galveston on Sunday for a seven night Western Caribbean cruise  called at ports including Roatan and Belize where passengers debarked as normal  save for the quarantined female and her companion.  The ship did not receive clearance from Mexican authorities at the port of Cozumel to disembark passengers and is proceeding directly to Galveston. According to Carnival's statement  the ship will return to port in Galveston on Sunday  October 19  as scheduled.  Passengers on the ship are being provided a $200 per person credit to their shipboard account and a 50 percent discount on a future cruise to make up for the missed visit to Cozumel.

In an article entitled Cruise Ships Balk At New Ebola Screening  Threaten Mass Cancellations  the leading news station in Belize said that the new stringent Ebola protocols caused delays due to the tight schedules and the large number of cruise passengers who come ashore.  There is mention in the article of Belize customs representatives taking and inspecting the passengers' passports during the screening. Belize’s government has already stopped issuing visas for nationals from Nigeria  Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia  according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Travelers who have visited any of these four countries in the past 30 days will be prohibited from entering Belize. This will require an inspection of passports  not just birth certificates many people use to cruise.    The cruise industry protocol so far relies upon passengers to voluntarily disclose this information on questionnaires  rather than the cruise lines inspecting the passengers' passports before the cruise to verify that they have not traveled to these countries in West Africa. Unlike Belize  the U.S. has not banned travelers from the infected African countries.  ,ebola-89c1c0a4c3234f4972a9b85114e05da83aa35598e42c20d894aa448b52cc63ea,0,1373,3,2016-05-12 07:52:19.955705,

But the modelers are hampered by the paucity of data on the current outbreak and lack of knowledge about how Ebola spreads. Funerals of Ebola victims are known to spread the virus  for example—but how many people are infected that way is not known. “Before this we have never had that much Ebola  so the epidemiology was never well developed ” says Ira Longini  a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “We are caught with our pants down.”  To a mathematician  combating any outbreak is at its core a fight to reduce one number: Re  the pathogen's effective reproductive rate  or how many people an infected person in turn infects on average. An Re above 1 means the disease will spread. Below 1  an outbreak will stall.  ,ebola-56369ee7c73b71e5a0b4753faf8b45c7328aef5a9a745e99cbe43a8dc990f9d1,0,979,2,2016-04-21 11:32:31.180542,

The software tools not only help connect people to data but they connect people to people with overlapping interests and areas of expertise. Caitlin’s data fed into the Ebola Open Data Repository  and she  herself  has plugged into another Ebola-related initiative  the Ebola Modelling Community call  which was launched by IBM scientists at the IBM Research – Almaden  our lab in San Jose  California.  The call  which takes place every Wednesday   is designed for researchers studying Ebola epidemiology and modeling. Mathematical models of Ebola are designed to produce accurate predictions of the path of the disease. Healthcare organizations and policy makers can use them to decide what actions to take. For instance  according to James Kaufman  the IBM Research scientists that organized the Ebola calls  health authorities can decide where to focus their limited resources based on assessments of their results.  ,ebola-82cc4783de98cf0b9681362adac22f761585cd1b64b3ef0e33b21ab1cfcb062f,0,1020,2,2016-04-21 11:57:34.418222, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,204,Computational Epidemiology,4322,As a mathematical epidemiologist  I can tell you that — despite the publicity over the first U.S. case of Ebola  in Dallas — there is some good news in the Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa: Ebola is not spreading nearly as fast as some scourges of the past.  I first worked on Ebola back in 2004 at Cornell University (and in collaboration with the Los Alamos National Laboratory) as part of my doctoral dissertation modeling how the virus is transmitted. Ebola was an interesting case study for our mathematical modeling of the spread of disease  as there were two relatively large and well-documented outbreaks where the impact of efforts to control the virus was evident (the 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo — formerly known as Zaire — and the 2000 outbreak in Uganda). It was intriguing — not to mention scary — to work on a disease that produced such a set of horrific symptoms with a fatality rate above 50 percent.  But I learned then that Ebola isn’t the fastest-spreading disease in human history. That distinction goes to measles. In the era prior to 1963  when children were first routinely vaccinated  each case of measles created 17 new secondary cases  with transmission spreading like wildfire in schools  especially. It was lethal in 1 out of every 3 to 4 cases. At this rate  getting infected with measles during childhood was inevitable and so were deaths.  Of course  this reproductive rate isn’t the whole story of epidemics. Each case of the “Spanish Flu” — which caused the pandemic of 1918 to 1920 that many call the worst in recent history — produced between two and five additional victims. While that’s much lower than measles  Spanish Flu was still able to spread worldwide because of the speed at which it moved  also known as its generation interval. Only two to three days elapsed between the first case and a generation of secondary cases. In other words  it doesn’t take long for the flu virus to settle into a new host and a substantial number of transmissions can occur even before a person realizes that he or she has the flu. An estimated 30 to 50 million people around the world died from the Spanish Flu.  The good news is that Ebola has a lower reproductive rate than measles in the pre-vaccination days or the Spanish flu. Our 2004 work  which produced the first estimates for Ebola’s reproductive rate by using mathematical modeling and epidemiological data from the Central African outbreaks  found that each case of Ebola produced 1.3 to 1.8 secondary cases on average. ,ebola-cf5f73a28bf292a75d4ee0318316715718fc1b3e656f46fd9133f46a85d62e10,0,2534,4,2016-04-21 12:05:21.725694,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,204,Computational Epidemiology,4423,The 2014 West African Ebola Outbreak is so far the largest and deadliest recorded in history. The affected countries  Sierra Leone  Guinea  Liberia  Nigeria  and recently Senegal have been struggling to contain and to mitigate the outbreak. We have developed a modeling approach aimed at assessing the progression of the epidemic in West Africa and its international spread under the assumption that the EVD outbreak continues to evolve at the current pace.   Our results have been published in PLOS Currents O﻿utbr﻿eaks. However  our modeling work has been motivated by the need for a rapid assessment of the EVD outbreak trends and the obtained results may change as more information becomes available from the EVD affected region and more refined sensitivity analysis can be implemented computationally. For this reason  the paper on PLOS Current Outbreaks shall be considered as a live paper that is constantly updated with new data  projections and analysis.   ,ebola-ba9cb102cb5ca88f53406e43019f14df57bbaa79b82aa131d6aa3c62c52d0a05,0,966,2,2016-04-21 13:01:12.813388, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,204,Computational Epidemiology,4463,To support the outbreak modeling  the research body needed a mix of computations  with compute and storage flexible enough to handle different workloads. It used four main simulation engines  varying in speed and granularity of its data collection. For example  one system checks social networks every second - working at a slower pace but offering more detailed information.  “Understanding all the nuances is the art behind which simulation engine we choose to perform different computational models ” Bryan Lewis  computational epidemiologist said.  The dedicated Ebola rapid response team of 30 needed to scale its storage to keep pace with this escalating growth at a moments notice. Just one instance of the population requires 10TB  and it may be run up to 15 times with varying simulations.  The dedicated Ebola rapid response team of 30 used a variety of HPC modelling tools developed in-house  including EpiFast  EpiSimdemics and Indemics an interactive SQL-based simulation query tool.

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,204,Computational Epidemiology,4642,We utilized a simple  two parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth and control  to characterize epidemic growth patterns in West Africa  to evaluate the degree to which the epidemic is being controlled  and to assess the potential implications of growth patterns for epidemic size. Models demonstrated good fits to data. Overall basic reproductive number (R0) for the epidemic was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.0  consistent with prior outbreaks. However  we identified only weak evidence for the occurrence of epidemic control in West Africa as a whole  and essentially no evidence for control in Liberia (though slowing of growth was seen in Guinea and Sierra Leone). It is projected that small reductions in transmission would prevent tens of thousands of future infections. These findings suggest that there is an extraordinary need for improved control measures for the 2014 Ebola epidemic  especially in Liberia  if catastrophe is to be averted.   ,ebola-83307a76dcd34c4c437d50c63a2e1e0d56c30dfd4dc3d0e639d58af13b0ad87e,0,965,2,2016-04-22 07:33:40.219494,

We begin with the difference between thin and fat tailed distributions applied to the number of infected individuals that can arise from a single one. Traditional epidemiological models consider the contagion process as described by $R_0$  the average number of new infected individuals arising from a single case. However  in a complex interdependent society it is possible for the actual number due to a single individual to dramatically differ from the average number  with severe consequences for the ability to contain an outbreak when it is just beginning. Our analysis raises doubts about the scientific validity of policy recommendations of public health authorities.

One challenge is that there is a dramatic increase in the number of people who can potentially be infected. Mathematically  we can show that in the absence of effective control measures  the final size of the outbreak will increase. There is a lot of interest in infectious disease epidemiology with better understanding the nature of the type of contacts people make and how they relate to the chance of an infection being passed between them.  ,ebola-cb54625b842a6bf18feeddb63b097069392cff1803df0e173de771e2430c880e,0,569,2,2016-05-02 12:27:52.818871,

His application  called HealthMap  then generates a map of that communication frequency and separates the data generated by those social media channels into structured data that can be used by  among others  public health agencies.  ,ebola-1b489538d399eb962d9cf8a6a2f4d15375b4b1d14b6c1cd41646ffdc5e6a144f,0,822,2,2016-05-03 10:15:58.756276,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,204,Computational Epidemiology,9593,Abstract: As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds  public health response isreliant on information on key epidemiological quantities  such as transmissionpotential and serial interval. Increasingly  transmission models fit toincidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Somewidely-used modeling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameterestimates and  consequently  errors in model-based forecasts. Even moreworryingly  in many such situations  confidence in parameter estimates andforecasts is itself far over-estimated  leading to the potential for largeerrors that mask their own presence. Fortunately  straightforward andcomputationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of thestandard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data.Second  we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to rawdata from the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not onlythat bias is thereby reduced  but that uncertainty in estimates and forecastsis better quantified and that  critically  lack of model fit is more readilydiagnosed. ,ebola-8939ff91c1eaa19a9b1bd3c60e0593d86b6e1c71791adf3229d6802c521debda,0,1222,2,2016-05-10 11:29:16.808666,

On March 14  their software — called HealthMap — registered the first sign of “a new disease that we do not know the name was reported in the prefecture of Macenta located 800 kilometers from Conakry  killing 8 people and leaving several others contaminated.”  ,ebola-157d6b09a4c59039c296da762efcab4c2b5b85256c75483517f4a0b160815ec8,0,489,4,2016-04-21 09:47:37.321818,

HealthMap does not include underreporting in its estimates  nor does the WHO.

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,205,Healthmap,4052,One site  HealthMap  used this hybrid model to spot signs of the emerging Ebola problem days before the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first report.   Scientific American In-Depth Report  “Ebola: What You Need to Know”   HealthMap’s automated text-processing algorithm has been tracking the Ebola outbreak since March 14  when the Guinean news site Africaguinee.com reported “a strange fever” in the country’s Macenta prefecture “marked by anal and nasal bleeding.” Within a few days HealthMap had picked up on a report by the Standard Digital news site indicating the “mystery hemorrhagic fever” had already claimed a few dozen victims. The doctor in charge of Guinea’s health ministry stated Ebola was being considered as the culprit  although these would have been the first recorded Ebola cases in that country. Authorities had soon narrowed down the cause to either Ebola or a related disease known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever. By March 22 a Nigerian news site caught HealthMap’s attention with an article that put the words “Ebola” and “outbreak” together.   Plotting help The Children’s Hospital Informatics Program launched HealthMap in 2006 as a way of using the growing number of digital resources—the Internet  RSS feeds and e-mail lists  to name a few—to plot information about emerging diseases worldwide on a Google Map. HealthMap flagged the current Ebola outbreak for a number of reasons­—in particular  its spread across borders from Guinea to Liberia  Sierra Leone and several other neighboring countries.   ,ebola-bf00c39dcbced71933509d99f083e5ce9f6e0aa29152c1af8cefb31c41369a73,50,1589,4,2016-04-21 10:05:52.621723,

Although an abundance of information is online  it’s hiding in different places and not accessible to the average person.  From there  HealthMap formed  surfacing as a data mining platform that gathers content from eyewitness reports  online news aggregators  expert-curated discussions and validated official reports; organizes it; and delivers intelligence in real-time. HealthMap filters through the data to create a real-time picture of emerging public health threats  leading the team to track everything from the flu to now Ebola.  “We’re engaging the public and making them more informed about infectious disease ” Brownstein said. “It’s all about putting the public back into public health.”,ebola-5fa6583a8273a50451c62a9a42eb539af44858ac50bffd20805366697334db48,0,854,4,2016-04-21 10:08:58.094499,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,205,Healthmap,4106,Nine days before the World Health Organization announced the African Ebola outbreak now making headlines  an algorithm had already spotted it. HealthMap  a data-driven mapping tool developed out of Boston Children's Hospital  detected a "mystery hemorrhagic fever" after mining thousands of web-based data sources for clues.  "We've been operating HealthMap for over eight years now " says cofounder Clark Freifeld. "One of the main things that has allowed it to flourish is the availability of large amounts of public event data being accessible on the Internet."  How This Disease-Seeking Algorithm Works  Those data sources include news reports  social media  international health organizations  government websites  and even the personal blogs of health care workers operating in affected areas. The team's custom-built web crawler traverses RSS feeds and APIs  analyzing the text from these content sources for disease-related terminology and clues about geography.  As anyone who's ever looked at the Internet knows  any bulk consumption of web content is bound to scoop up tons of noise  especially when sources like Twitter and blogs are involved. To cope with this  HealthMap applies a machine learning algorithm to filter out irrelevant information like posts about "Bieber fever" or uses of terms like "infection" and "outbreak" that don't pertain to actual public health events.  "The algorithm actually looks at hundreds of thousands of example articles that have been labeled by our analysts and uses the examples to pick up on key words and phrases that tend to be associated with actual outbreak reports " explains Freifeld. "The algorithm is continually improving  learning from our analysts through a feedback loop."  Disease Moves Fast  But Data Moves Faster  The latest string of Ebola infections became public knowledge on March 23 when the World Health Organization issued its first report on it. Since then  the outbreakâwhich appears to have started with a 2-year-old boy in Guineaâhas spread to other countries in Africa and killed over 1 000 people.  By that point  HealthMap had already picked up on the spread of the virus  even if it hadn't been identified as Ebola yet. In this case  the automated detection of the disease didn't help stem the outbreak  but the promise of such machine intelligence is hard to deny.  In addition to the breadth of the content available online  Freifeld credits the "availability of inexpensive Internet hosting and computation resources" with allowing HealthMap to crunch and store so much data. Clearly  such a thing would not have been possible even five years ago. And with the trends of big data and machine intelligence being as young as they are  one can only imagine where technology like this is headed.  In the short term  the team behind HealthMap is busily working on improving its filtering algorithms and adding new sources of data  one of which is decidedly old-school.  "We allow anyone  anywhere in the world to submit a direct report of an outbreak event and as more people become connected  Freifeld says. "It opens even greater possibilities."

HealthMap  which launched in 2006  is the brainchild of a few dozen scientists  epidemiologists  and software programmers at the Boston Children's Hospital. They wanted to design a tool that could take bits of information scattered across the internet and shape it into knowledge about infectious diseases around the world. So they wrote software that pulls  sifts  and organizes all kinds of information from thousands of sources  including government websites  NGOs  local news agencies  Twitter and Facebook and turns it all into a neat  easy-to-use disease-tracking database.  Social media have been goldmines of information  but they've always been hard goldmines to mine.

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,205,Healthmap,9314,Earlier this month  Harvard’s HealthMap service made world headlines for monitoring early mentions of the current Ebola outbreak on March 14  2014  “nine days before the World Health Organization formally announced the epidemic ” and issuing its first alert on March 19. Much of the coverage of HealthMap’s success has emphasized that its early warning came from using massive computing power to sift out early indicators from millions of social media posts and other informal media.Â   As one blog put it: “So how did a computer algorithm pick up on the start of the outbreak before the WHO? As it turns out  some of the first health care workers to see Ebola in Guinea regularly blog about their work. As they began to write about treating patients with Ebola-like symptoms  a few people on social media mentioned the blog posts. And it didn’t take long for HealthMap to detect these mentions.”Â   The U.S. government’s Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)  which helps fund HealthMap  has used this success story as evidence that the approaches used in its Open Source Indicators program can indeed “beat the news” and provide the earliest warnings of impending disease outbreaks and conflict,ebola-56adfef2792d903362b5bdaafd907b501fb71722554479f7013ca8c1a04b1773,1,1216,3,2016-05-10 08:35:19.673631,

HealthMap is a database that sifts through and gathers information from millions of social media posts and other online sources. Then  it uses that data to create a visual report of global disease outbreaks.  The fact that HealthMap was able to anticipate the outbreak gives credibility to the idea of using data in disease prevention. While 9 days isn’t a huge amount of time  further efforts and improvements could could alert us to possible dangers with enough time to send the right personnel to a specific area. Part of the reason Ebola has been so devastating is there weren’t enough resources to contain the threat.

Much of the coverage of HealthMap’s success has emphasized that its early warning came from using massive computing power to sift out early indicators from millions of social media posts and other informal media.Â   As one blog put it: “So how did a computer algorithm pick up on the start of the outbreak before the WHO? As it turns out  some of the first health care workers to see Ebola in Guinea regularly blog about their work. As they began to write about treating patients with Ebola-like symptoms  a few people on social media mentioned the blog posts.

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,206,SEIR,4140,The SEIR-type model is a standard epidemiological model for diseases with dynamics like those of Ebola  with the exposed period in particular necessary to account for the latency between initial exposure to the disease and the later onset of symptoms and infectiousness. More complex models have been used to analyse Ebola dynamics in some studies3 11  however SEIR provides sufficient detail in this context.  ,ebola-47144cb37c95694307783e228b551683e74bac10500fbc15fc0f3e918d444409,0,411,2,2016-04-21 10:51:45.770871, 
1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,206,SEIR,4143,The stochastic SEIR model used here effectively represents the necessary components of Ebola dynamics for this study. More complex models have been applied in other studies  incorporating e.g.  specific hospitalisation dynamics or separate removal classes (death vs. recovery) allowing specific incorporation of post-death contact. However  in this study it was most parsimonious to use a simple model with fewer assumptions as to disease dynamics or model parameters,ebola-47144cb37c95694307783e228b551683e74bac10500fbc15fc0f3e918d444409,0,467,2,2016-04-21 10:52:46.960121,

Figures 2 and 3 show that final size predictions are consistently lower than those of a simple SEIR-type model in exponential growth mode  as the logistic curve captures a slowdown in transmission in both countries. We note however that final size predictions are more variable for Sierra Leone and Guinea as estimates keep increasing with inclusion of additional observations  suggesting that EBOV transmission is still high in these countries and the outbreak is far from over.

The timeline of 300 days is longer than most of the previously recorded outbreaks of EVD or Marburg Virus Disease.	  Model Description: Estimate the daily movement of patients using disease probabilities for three (3) different categories of isolation: Hospitalization  Home Isolation  and No Home Isolation. We used probabilities  drawn from reports of previous EVD outbreaks  to model the daily movement of patients between and within the various disease categories (i.e.  susceptible  incubation  infectious  revocery/death).	  Type of Model: Susceptibile  Incubation  Infectious  Recovery (SIIR) Model.	  ,ebola-09f938d3714f606b9a33fc536ea50e474d16e786e58319cf9baf34da823706f5,0,921,1,2016-04-22 07:38:46.971836,

1,Ebola,2,assr2,403,Modeling,219,BDEI,4038,Birth-death models assume a transmission rate with which infected individuals transmit  a becoming-noninfectious rate with which infected individuals recover or die  and a sampling probability  which is the probability at which an infectious person is sampled and sequenced. Such a model naturally accounts for incomplete sampling and  since the sampling probability is a parameter in our model  this quantity may also be estimated. In particular  we run birth-death analyses using the models depicted in Figure 1. We explain the assumptions of these models in the following.  The birth-death (BD) model17 allows the three parameters  transmission rate  becoming-noninfectious rate  and sampling probability to change in a piecewise constant fashion.  To model the spread of EBOV more realistically  we further extend the birth-death model to allow for an exposed class of infected people. The exposed class is entered upon infection  and an exposed individual moves from the exposed to the infectious class with a constant incubation rate. This model is referred to as the birth-death exposed-infected (BDEI) model18 19. In the BDEI model we assume that only infectious people are sampled  since exposed patients are asymptomatic.  BD and BDEI assume that individuals become noninfectious upon sampling. ,ebola-4bf5690f4f323d4de50e65cfe023b27b7dd93c5c49a8354057c9ff19ce3c0578,0,1305,2,2016-04-21 09:56:36.386269,
